#The Sematic Web
The goal of this coursework is to define, populate and query an ontology. 
For the project it the topic about Games and Computer Engines was chosen.

The Ontology is made with Protégé-OWL2. 
Population of the Ontology is made with SPARQL(1.1) from English and Russian dbpedia.org sources. 
Queries were made with SPARQL.

##Resources
- Protégé-OWL2
- SPARQL
- Python

##Resourse structure
The first ontology is in “project”, “basic” file of code with populated ontology, the result of populating “new”, file “query_basic” where I made a query for first populated ontology, file “bonus” with using second resource, the result of that “new_full” ontology and file with the code “query_bonus” with the query of second populated ontology.

##Getting started
- Run Basic.py. It will give a new ontology “new.owl” as a result
- To query it, run “query_basic”. The result will be in console
- To get query from second populated ontology, run “Query_bonus.py”
