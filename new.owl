    <ns2:abstract>Sacrifice is a real-time strategy video game published by Interplay Entertainment in 2000 for the Windows 98 platform. Developed by Shiny Entertainment the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. Impressing reviewers with its graphics, Sacrifice was the first commercial video game to make full use of video graphics cards that can process transform, clipping, and lighting instructions. The game was ported to Mac OS 9.2 in 2001.Unlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, Sacrifice places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana—energy for casting spells—constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.Sacrifice was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses tessellation: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, Sacrifice can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as Tim Curry, and the musical compositions of Kevin Manthei. Sacrifice was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw. Despite winning several awards, Sacrifice was not a commercial success, and no sequels are planned.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The ImagiNation Network (INN), aka The Sierra Network (TSN) and CyberPark, was an early online multiplayer gaming system. Developed by Sierra On-Line in 1989, and first available to the public in 1991, the ImagiNation Network was a unique online gaming network that gave subscribers from all over the U.S. a place where they could "play games, make friends and have fun". With a wide variety of games including RPGs, a World War I aeroplane simulations, live trivia, card and board games, almost every user could find something enjoyable to play. INN also featured an electronic post office, many bulletin boards, chat rooms, and the company boasted of having "more than 200 groups, clubs and special events online."Sierra On-Line founder Ken Williams wanted to create a network that even his grandmother would find easy to use, and to that end INN featured a unique emphasis on a friendly, graphics-heavy interface. Each user was represented by a persona which they assembled using INN's built-in 'facemaker'. The facemaker was incredibly detailed, with enough different options to construct over 84 million unique personas. Users could then indicate their level of skill in various games, in order to encourage fair match-making between players, and a short list of hobbies to help match interests with new friends.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>ViOS (Visual Internet Operating System) was a client-server software system designed by Julian Lombardi in the mid-1990s and built by a team he led at ViOS Inc. from 1999-2001 as a way of spatially organizing all Internet-deliverable resources (including web pages) into a massively scaled multiuser 3D environment with users of the system represented as customizable avatars. The basic concept behind the "ViOS 3D Internet Viewer" was to take the virtual world of the entire Internet and adapt it to a physical representation of large virtual landscape, complete with mountains, rivers and cities. This approach was taken because of the belief that virtual landscapes resembling our physical world are more conducive to exploration and social interaction than the flat and abstracted world of the current document-based Internet.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge, known as Rockman World (ロックマンワールド, Rokkuman Wārudo) in Japan, is a platform video game by Capcom for the Nintendo Game Boy. It is the first game in the handheld series of the Mega Man franchise. It was first released in Japan on July 26, 1991 and was localized in North America that December and in Europe the following year. The game continues the adventures of the android hero Mega Man as he once again confronts the evil Dr. Wily, who has recently dispatched his revived "Robot Masters" and a new "Mega Man Killer" named Enker.Dr. Wily's Revenge is an action and platform game in same vein as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games. The player is tasked with completing a series of four stages in any order desired. Beating a stage's boss will earn the player a special weapon that can be selected at will and used throughout the rest of the game. Dr. Wily's Revenge specifically takes components of the original Mega Man and Mega Man 2, including their enemies, stage aesthetics, and Robot Masters.According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was the first Mega Man game to be outsourced to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Darkman was developed by Twilight and published by Ocean Software in 1991. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name.In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Half-Life (stylized as HλLF-LIFE) is a science fiction video game developed by Valve Corporation, the company's debut product and the first in the Half-Life series. First released in 1998 by Sierra Studios for Windows PCs, the game was also released for the PlayStation 2; Mac OS X and Linux ports became available in January 2013. In Half-Life, players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground research facility whose research and experiments into teleportation technology have gone disastrously wrong.Valve, set up by former Microsoft employees, had difficulty finding a publisher for the game, with many believing that it was too ambitious a project. Sierra On-Line eventually signed the game after expressing interest in making a 3D action game. The game had its first major public appearance at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Designed for Windows, the game's engine, GoldSrc, was a heavily modified version of id Software's Quake game engine with code portions from the id Tech 2 engine.On its release, the game received universal acclaim, with critics praising the seamlessly flowing narrative, presentation and realistic gameplay, and it won over fifty PC Game of the Year awards. Its gameplay influenced the design of first-person shooters for years after its release, and it is widely considered to be one of the greatest computer games of all time. IGN ranked Half-Life as the number one greatest first-person shooter of all time, stating that "When you look at the history of first-person shooters, it all breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-Half-Life and post-Half-Life eras." Half-Life had sold eight million copies by 16 November 2004, and 9.3 million copies by December 2008. By 14 July 2007, the Half-Life franchise as a whole had sold over 20 million units. Half-Life was followed by the 2004 sequel Half-Life 2, which also received universal critical acclaim. Half-Life has had a notable cultural effect with its community mods and sequels spawning a large fanbase and cult following.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Project Eden is an action-adventure game developed by Core Design and published Eidos Interactive for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2. Players switch between control of four UPA (Urban Protection Agency) agents, each with their own special abilities, as they work their way through a city that has grown upward and upward, leaving delving buildings and neighborhoods "below city limits". Among other unique mechanics of Project Eden is the fact that player characters do not die; instead, they are respawned at the last checkpoint, where their health is fully restored. With its emphasis on puzzle-solving over combat, the game may be thought of as a cyberpunk updating of The Lost Vikings, as it has more in common with that game developed by Blizzard Entertainment than traditional first- or third-person shooters. A single player can control any of the four characters at any given time, and other players can jump in at any time and assume control of team members.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Ōkami (Japanese: 大神, literally "great god", "great spirit" or "wolf" if written as 狼) is an action-adventure video game developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom. It was released for Sony's PlayStation 2 video game console in 2006 in Japan and North America, and 2007 in Europe and Australia. Despite the closure of Clover Studio a few months after the game's initial release, a version for Nintendo's Wii console was developed and produced by Ready at Dawn, Tose and Capcom, which was released in North America in April 2008, in Europe in June 2008, and in Japan in October 2009.Set sometime in classical Japanese history, Ōkami combines several Japanese myths, legends and folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess, named Amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf. It features a distinct sumi-e-inspired cel-shaded visual style and the Celestial Brush, a gesture-system to perform miracles.Ōkami was one of the last PlayStation 2 games selected for release prior to the release of the PlayStation 3. Although it suffered from poor sales, Ōkami received critical acclaim, earning the title of IGN's 2006 Game of the Year. The Wii version has earned similar praise though the motion control scheme has received mixed reviews.A high-definition port of the game was released on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network in October 2012 and for retail in Japan in November 2012, supporting the use of the PlayStation Move motion controller. A sequel for the Nintendo DS titled Ōkamiden was released in Japan in September 2010, followed by North America and Europe in March 2011.</ns2:abstract>

Reviews for the game have been positive with critics praising the gameplay and graphics employed while the length of the story mode was criticized.

    <ns2:abstract>Rhythm Tengoku (リズム天国, Rizumu Tengoku, lit. Rhythm Heaven) is a rhythm game developed by Nintendo SPD and published by Nintendo. It was released on August 3, 2006, and was the last game developed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. An arcade version of the game was reprogrammed and published by Sega on September 20, 2007. Both versions were released in Japan exclusively. A sequel was released for the Nintendo DS titled Rhythm Heaven which was released in Japan, North America, Australia, and Europe (the latter which was titled Rhythm Paradise). Its most recent release was for the Wii titled Rhythm Heaven Fever. It began as an idea created by its composer and supervisor Tsunku who proposed it to Nintendo due to his belief that they could do a better job with it than he could.Rhythm Tengoku's gameplay focuses on audio cues rather than visual cues to convey information to players. It features a number of unique stages which have their own type of rhythm and gameplay. Players follow the rhythm until the end where they are given a score based on their performance. The gameplay and music were both well received by critics and consumers. Parallels have been drawn between it and the developer's previous work on the WarioWare series.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Drac's Night Out is the title of an unreleased video game developed by Mark Lesser and Rex Bradford of Microsmiths that was produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe.In the game the player controlled the infamous Count Dracula who, while wearing Reebok Pumps, had to first work his way down his castle while avoiding the hostile villagers. This could be accomplished by hypnotizing the villagers with your vampiric gaze. Or by pulling a lever to spring one of many Rube Goldberg-esque hidden traps. Once subdued, you can then suck their blood and briefly turn into a bat to navigate through the tower. Scattered throughout these towers is also a Reebok Pump power-up. Once activated, you are given a temporary speed-boost as well as the ability to jump over villagers and holes.When you escape the castle you are then given a large open town to explore and search for your bride Mina. This will require hints such as finding maps and compasses from villagers. Patrolling the streets are hostile mobs and non hostile villagers. After sucking enough blood, you temporarily transform into an invulnerable wolf to cover distance more quickly.You are also given the ability to suck the blood of sleeping villagers that will transform into Vampiresses and lead you nearer to Minas location. Some villagers drop items like keys and flowers, used to open gates and homes. You can also travel through secret underground shortcuts. Once you discover the building housing Mina, a congratulatory picture of the pair walking together appears and leads to the next 'round'.Although completed the game was never officially released. However, a prototype has since been discovered and its ROM data released to the internet. Elaborate NES cart reproductions now exist for collectors as well.Mark Lesser on the Reebok Pump addition:"We developed this game as consultants to Parker Bros. As we neared completion of the game, PB insisted that we include Reebok as a sponsor of the game by having Dracula wear Reebok Pump shoes! Reluctantly we complied, but the sponsorship was not enough to save the game and, although completed, it was never marketed."</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Darkman was developed by Twilight and published by Ocean Software in 1991. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name.In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Guardic (ガーディック, Gādikku) is a shoot 'em up video game for the MSX computer. It was created and developed by Satoshi "Pac" Fujishima while working for Compile, the creators of other shoot 'em up games such as Zanac, The Guardian Legend, and Blazing Lazers. Guardic is unique in that the player can choose stages, which are connected by a maze. Each stage is a non-scrollable single screen and has 1 to 3 groups of different enemies. The player can "buy" ship power-ups like speed, weaponry, and special powers before each stage—a departure from the traditional scrolling-shooter power-up system. In the end of each stage, the ship could safely fly through a scrollable maze to another stage.Guardic is the second title in a MSX trilogy by Fujishima, which started with Final Justice (1985) and ended with Blaster Burn (1990). In this last installment the player commands Guardic II as its main weapon against Gose, an invasion army from outer space. It did inspire a cult classic of a sequel, the NES shooter The Guardian Legend (known as Guardic Gaiden in Japan).In August 2011 D4 Enterprise released an emulated version for iOS devices.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Sacrifice is a real-time strategy video game published by Interplay Entertainment in 2000 for the Windows 98 platform. Developed by Shiny Entertainment the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. Impressing reviewers with its graphics, Sacrifice was the first commercial video game to make full use of video graphics cards that can process transform, clipping, and lighting instructions. The game was ported to Mac OS 9.2 in 2001.Unlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, Sacrifice places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana—energy for casting spells—constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.Sacrifice was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses tessellation: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, Sacrifice can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as Tim Curry, and the musical compositions of Kevin Manthei. Sacrifice was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw. Despite winning several awards, Sacrifice was not a commercial success, and no sequels are planned.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Project Eden is an action-adventure game developed by Core Design and published Eidos Interactive for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2. Players switch between control of four UPA (Urban Protection Agency) agents, each with their own special abilities, as they work their way through a city that has grown upward and upward, leaving delving buildings and neighborhoods "below city limits". Among other unique mechanics of Project Eden is the fact that player characters do not die; instead, they are respawned at the last checkpoint, where their health is fully restored. With its emphasis on puzzle-solving over combat, the game may be thought of as a cyberpunk updating of The Lost Vikings, as it has more in common with that game developed by Blizzard Entertainment than traditional first- or third-person shooters. A single player can control any of the four characters at any given time, and other players can jump in at any time and assume control of team members.</ns2:abstract>

It is a re-creation of the classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure of the same name using the 3.5 edition rules.

The Temple of Elemental Evil was released in autumn of 2003.The release was criticized for stability issues and other bugs. The turn-based tactical combat, however, was generally thought to be implemented well, and is arguably the most faithful representation of the then-current tabletop role-playing game ("3.5e") rules in a video game. This game still has a very active fanbase, with many improvements and bugfixes added.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>ViOS (Visual Internet Operating System) was a client-server software system designed by Julian Lombardi in the mid-1990s and built by a team he led at ViOS Inc. from 1999-2001 as a way of spatially organizing all Internet-deliverable resources (including web pages) into a massively scaled multiuser 3D environment with users of the system represented as customizable avatars. The basic concept behind the "ViOS 3D Internet Viewer" was to take the virtual world of the entire Internet and adapt it to a physical representation of large virtual landscape, complete with mountains, rivers and cities. This approach was taken because of the belief that virtual landscapes resembling our physical world are more conducive to exploration and social interaction than the flat and abstracted world of the current document-based Internet.</ns2:abstract>

Designed for Windows, the game's engine, GoldSrc, was a heavily modified version of id Software's Quake game engine with code portions from the id Tech 2 engine.On its release, the game received universal acclaim, with critics praising the seamlessly flowing narrative, presentation and realistic gameplay, and it won over fifty PC Game of the Year awards. Its gameplay influenced the design of first-person shooters for years after its release, and it is widely considered to be one of the greatest computer games of all time. IGN ranked Half-Life as the number one greatest first-person shooter of all time, stating that "When you look at the history of first-person shooters, it all breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-Half-Life and post-Half-Life eras." Half-Life had sold eight million copies by 16 November 2004, and 9.3 million copies by December 2008. By 14 July 2007, the Half-Life franchise as a whole had sold over 20 million units.

    <ns2:abstract>The Simpsons Game is an action/platformer video game based on the animated television series The Simpsons and loosely on the film, made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by Simpsons writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.The game follows the five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.Video game critics gave the game a mixed to positive reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly.

As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.Xbox and GameCube versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled.

    <ns2:abstract>Half-Life (stylized as HλLF-LIFE) is a science fiction video game developed by Valve Corporation, the company's debut product and the first in the Half-Life series. First released in 1998 by Sierra Studios for Windows PCs, the game was also released for the PlayStation 2; Mac OS X and Linux ports became available in January 2013. In Half-Life, players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground research facility whose research and experiments into teleportation technology have gone disastrously wrong.Valve, set up by former Microsoft employees, had difficulty finding a publisher for the game, with many believing that it was too ambitious a project. Sierra On-Line eventually signed the game after expressing interest in making a 3D action game. The game had its first major public appearance at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Designed for Windows, the game's engine, GoldSrc, was a heavily modified version of id Software's Quake game engine with code portions from the id Tech 2 engine.On its release, the game received universal acclaim, with critics praising the seamlessly flowing narrative, presentation and realistic gameplay, and it won over fifty PC Game of the Year awards. Its gameplay influenced the design of first-person shooters for years after its release, and it is widely considered to be one of the greatest computer games of all time. IGN ranked Half-Life as the number one greatest first-person shooter of all time, stating that "When you look at the history of first-person shooters, it all breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-Half-Life and post-Half-Life eras." Half-Life had sold eight million copies by 16 November 2004, and 9.3 million copies by December 2008. By 14 July 2007, the Half-Life franchise as a whole had sold over 20 million units. Half-Life was followed by the 2004 sequel Half-Life 2, which also received universal critical acclaim. Half-Life has had a notable cultural effect with its community mods and sequels spawning a large fanbase and cult following.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Half-Life (stylized as HλLF-LIFE) is a science fiction video game developed by Valve Corporation, the company's debut product and the first in the Half-Life series. First released in 1998 by Sierra Studios for Windows PCs, the game was also released for the PlayStation 2; Mac OS X and Linux ports became available in January 2013. In Half-Life, players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground research facility whose research and experiments into teleportation technology have gone disastrously wrong.Valve, set up by former Microsoft employees, had difficulty finding a publisher for the game, with many believing that it was too ambitious a project. Sierra On-Line eventually signed the game after expressing interest in making a 3D action game. The game had its first major public appearance at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Designed for Windows, the game's engine, GoldSrc, was a heavily modified version of id Software's Quake game engine with code portions from the id Tech 2 engine.On its release, the game received universal acclaim, with critics praising the seamlessly flowing narrative, presentation and realistic gameplay, and it won over fifty PC Game of the Year awards. Its gameplay influenced the design of first-person shooters for years after its release, and it is widely considered to be one of the greatest computer games of all time. IGN ranked Half-Life as the number one greatest first-person shooter of all time, stating that "When you look at the history of first-person shooters, it all breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-Half-Life and post-Half-Life eras." Half-Life had sold eight million copies by 16 November 2004, and 9.3 million copies by December 2008. By 14 July 2007, the Half-Life franchise as a whole had sold over 20 million units. Half-Life was followed by the 2004 sequel Half-Life 2, which also received universal critical acclaim. Half-Life has had a notable cultural effect with its community mods and sequels spawning a large fanbase and cult following.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Firebug was a 1982 computer game by MUSE Software for the Apple II computer. The game was released on cassette tape and on floppy disk. It was written by Silas Warner, whose most famous accomplishment was Castle Wolfenstein.The player controlled a "firebug", a 3-by-3-pixel square with a tail stretching behind it. The player picked up gas cans—each represented by a single pixel on the screen—and dropped a can by pressing the joystick button. The end of the player's tail glowed white, and ignited any gas can that it came adjacent to, including cans the player had dropped. Once a gas can ignited, it burst into colorful flames, which ignited any walls they touch.The goal was to burn down the highest possible percentage of the walls on the level, and escape down the stairs to the next level without touching any flames with the body of the firebug. Tail collisions with fire were expected and ignored. As the game progressed, each level featured tighter mazes of walls, increasing the penalty for player mistakes; and the player's tail shortened, causing player-dropped gas cans to explode sooner.Firebug used the Apple II's lo-res graphics mode, which displayed 16 colors but which had a pixel resolution of only 40 wide by 48 high. Hence, the game looked remarkably crude, even by the standards of Apple II games. At the time, the colorful fire effect was notable.The game was an inspiration for Pyro 2.Firebug was not critically well received.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Darkman was developed by Twilight and published by Ocean Software in 1991. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name.In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.</ns2:abstract>

Players control a witch, who aims to become the "Witch Queen" by defeating an enemy called the "Pumpking".Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron originated as licensed video game of the horror film Halloween. Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized that there were no technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.The game received praise from video game magazines, who focused on the graphics and two different modes of play. A common complaint was Cauldron's excessive difficulty. The following year, Palace released a direct sequel titled Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back is a computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace) as a sequel to their 1985 title Cauldron. The two-dimensional (2D) platform game was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a bouncing pumpkin that is on a quest of vengeance against the "Witch Queen". The roles of the two were reversed from the first game, in which the witch defeated a monster pumpkin.Following the success of Cauldron, Palace employee Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.Cauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64. It was released in the following years on other systems and as re-releases. The game received praise, mainly for its audio-visuals, in video game magazines. Difficulty in handling the bouncing pumpkin's movement was a common complaint, although reviewers felt the overall package was of good value.</ns2:abstract>

The basic concept behind the "ViOS 3D Internet Viewer" was to take the virtual world of the entire Internet and adapt it to a physical representation of large virtual landscape, complete with mountains, rivers and cities. This approach was taken because of the belief that virtual landscapes resembling our physical world are more conducive to exploration and social interaction than the flat and abstracted world of the current document-based Internet.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Madness and the Minotaur is a text adventure game for the TRS-80 Color Computer. Developed by Spectral Associates in 1981, the game lulls players into a false sense of security by providing a comparatively easy and static early game. Once the player walks down the stairs, however, the game rapidly degenerates into what may have been the most difficult text adventure labyrinth ever created.The goal of the game is to retrieve a number of treasures. In the course of doing this, the player will encounter other objects that may or may not be useful. Often, the player needs one object to act as a "key" for another. There is no rhyme or reason to this. The player doesn't use the key object to obtain the other; he just needs to be carrying it. For example, the player may see a shield. Perhaps the player needs to be carrying the dagger to get the shield. If the player has the dagger, the shield is reachable; if he does not, it is not. With the exception of a randomly appearing "oracle", the game gives no indication of what objects are needed to reach a treasure. There are various magic spells that can be learned throughout the game that have various effects.</ns2:abstract>

The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Sailor Moon video games were released in Japan during the height of the media franchise's popularity. By 1998, twenty games were released. The games released as of 1995, each had sales figures of about 200,000 to 300,000. They have never been released in any other country, with the single exception of the Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon game developed by Angel, which was released in France in 1994. The games are hard to find in any other country unless downloaded from the internet as ROMs.Bandai produced a small number of Sailor Moon games, but the majority were handled by a Japanese game company called Angel. Early games were side-scrolling fighters, whereas later games were unique puzzle games, and even later titles chose to go a versus fighting game style. Another Story was the only game to stand out, being a role-playing video game. Panic in Nakayoshi World was also released, an overhead Adventures of Lolo-style puzzle game featuring characters from various Nakayoshi-printed manga. Sailor Moon and Chibi Moon are playable characters.The games mainly saw release on the Super Famicom, with the first side-scroller being ported to the Mega Drive. A separate arcade side-scrolling fighter was also released. In addition, two side-scrolling adventure games were produced for the Game Boy (Sailormoon and Sailormoon R), and a side-scrolling game was also produced for the Game Gear (Sailormoon S).The first versus fighting game from the series was released for the 3DO. However, as the 3DO did not sell well outside of Japan, this game has gone largely unnoticed. Produced by Bandai themselves as opposed to Angel for the other two, this game is considerably different. A final versus fighting game was released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.The last Sailor Moon-related game to date was released in November 2001 - Happy Chibiusa World.A game was released in the U.S. for the PC. It was a minigame compilation titled The 3D Adventures of Sailor Moon. Aside from the theme, the games did nothing to tie in to the series.On July 15, 2010, Bandai Namco Games Europe announced development of a new Sailor Moon video game for Nintendo DS, Sailor Moon: La Luna Splende, an adventure game featuring environmental puzzles that takes place in Molly/Naru's dreams.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Far Cry Instincts is a first-person shooter video game developed and published by Ubisoft for Xbox that was released on September 27, 2005. A remake of the original PC version of Far Cry, Instincts is less open-ended and more linear, due to the console's reduced processing power which prevents the full rendering of the PC version's vast islands and landscape. However, Instincts added new multiplayer modes, weapons, and feral abilities, the latter being reflected in the modified storyline. Ports of the game were also planned for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube but were canceled.An arcade version developed by Global VR was released in 2007 under the name Paradise Lost.Ubisoft has released a sequel, Far Cry Instincts: Evolution for the Xbox. Also released was Far Cry Instincts: Predator for the Xbox 360, which contains both Far Cry Instincts and Evolution running in high definition mode.</ns2:abstract>

The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Darkman was developed by Twilight and published by Ocean Software in 1991. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name.In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.</ns2:abstract>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Half-Life_(video_game)">
    <ns2:abstract>Half-Life (stylized as HλLF-LIFE) is a science fiction video game developed by Valve Corporation, the company's debut product and the first in the Half-Life series. First released in 1998 by Sierra Studios for Windows PCs, the game was also released for the PlayStation 2; Mac OS X and Linux ports became available in January 2013. In Half-Life, players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground research facility whose research and experiments into teleportation technology have gone disastrously wrong.Valve, set up by former Microsoft employees, had difficulty finding a publisher for the game, with many believing that it was too ambitious a project. Sierra On-Line eventually signed the game after expressing interest in making a 3D action game. The game had its first major public appearance at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Designed for Windows, the game's engine, GoldSrc, was a heavily modified version of id Software's Quake game engine with code portions from the id Tech 2 engine.On its release, the game received universal acclaim, with critics praising the seamlessly flowing narrative, presentation and realistic gameplay, and it won over fifty PC Game of the Year awards. Its gameplay influenced the design of first-person shooters for years after its release, and it is widely considered to be one of the greatest computer games of all time. IGN ranked Half-Life as the number one greatest first-person shooter of all time, stating that "When you look at the history of first-person shooters, it all breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-Half-Life and post-Half-Life eras." Half-Life had sold eight million copies by 16 November 2004, and 9.3 million copies by December 2008. By 14 July 2007, the Half-Life franchise as a whole had sold over 20 million units. Half-Life was followed by the 2004 sequel Half-Life 2, which also received universal critical acclaim. Half-Life has had a notable cultural effect with its community mods and sequels spawning a large fanbase and cult following.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Guardic (ガーディック, Gādikku) is a shoot 'em up video game for the MSX computer. It was created and developed by Satoshi "Pac" Fujishima while working for Compile, the creators of other shoot 'em up games such as Zanac, The Guardian Legend, and Blazing Lazers. Guardic is unique in that the player can choose stages, which are connected by a maze. Each stage is a non-scrollable single screen and has 1 to 3 groups of different enemies. The player can "buy" ship power-ups like speed, weaponry, and special powers before each stage—a departure from the traditional scrolling-shooter power-up system. In the end of each stage, the ship could safely fly through a scrollable maze to another stage.Guardic is the second title in a MSX trilogy by Fujishima, which started with Final Justice (1985) and ended with Blaster Burn (1990). In this last installment the player commands Guardic II as its main weapon against Gose, an invasion army from outer space. It did inspire a cult classic of a sequel, the NES shooter The Guardian Legend (known as Guardic Gaiden in Japan).In August 2011 D4 Enterprise released an emulated version for iOS devices.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Cause of Death: Can you Catch the Killer? (almost always shortened to Cause of Death or CoD) is a video game developed and published by EA Mobile for iOS devices on December 16, 2010. While being almost identical in gameplay, the game is intended for a more mature audience than its companion game Surviving High School, as the game revolves around crime and serial killers and their pursuit by law enforcement (and it's text depicts some rather graphic and suggestive things at times). Understandingly, the suggested age on the App Store is 12+. Cause of Death is a visual novel that is divided into a series of volumes, each of which is made up of eight chapters (excluding the first and fourteenth volumes). The base game (which is free from the App Store) comes with the entire first Volume—future content must be downloaded either by "Episodes on Demand" or "Now Airing".</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Simpsons Game is an action/platformer video game based on the animated television series The Simpsons and loosely on the film, made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by Simpsons writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.The game follows the five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.Video game critics gave the game a mixed to positive reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.Xbox and GameCube versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled. This is possibly due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.</ns2:abstract>

It has role-playing video game and world-controlling elements, and allows the player to follow a number of characters (such as Asuka Langley Soryu, Shinji Ikari, Pen², etc.) through multiple versions of the main plot of the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. The PlayStation Portable port was released 2006-04-27 as Neon Genesis Evangelion 2 -Another Cases-.The 24 topics were named in total "Classified Information" (Kimitsu Jouhou). The topics considerably expand upon the back-story: Adam and Lilith are settlers sent to Earth in what would become Earth's moon by a "First Ancestral Race", with "Seeds" and Spears of Longinus. The various Angels seek out the Black Moon of Lilith because they are seeking Lilith, or Adam; and so on. While the information seems to have been based on extensive interviews with Hideaki Anno, creator of the franchise, the canonicity of the information in the game has never been officially stated. Besides the additional information, Neon Genesis Evangelion 2 also introduced a number of additions like F-type Equipment and the final products of the Jet Alone project (as in some storylines, the A HUMAN WORK episode does not end in the cancellation of the Jet Alone project).</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold is a live-action laserdisc video game produced by American Laser Games, released for the arcade, Sega CD, 3DO, CD-i and DOS, the first release being in 1992; the quality of the video is the lowest on Sega CD. A sequel to the moderately popular Mad Dog McCree, the game abandoned the rather simple style of the original, introducing elements that can be considered "Hollywood", including dynamic shootout scenes and in-game music, as opposed to the original's almost complete lack thereof. Like the first game, the player follows the storyline and is required to quickly shoot certain enemies to proceed on the quest. The game was re-released by Digital Leisure in 2003 on DVD-Video and again in 2009 on the Wii as part of the Mad Dog McCree Gunslinger Pack, a compilation that also includes the first Mad Dog game as well as The Last Bounty Hunter.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Juiced is a racing video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and mobile phone. The game was delayed for release in 2004 because its original publisher, Acclaim, went bankrupt. Juice Games and Fund 4 Games retained the i.p ownership and sold the game to THQ, who funded the project for a further 6 months to make improvements.In early 2006, British software publisher Focus Multimedia re-released the PC version of Juiced at a new budget price as part of its "Essential" games range.The game offers different modes including career and arcade that present the player with challenges of increasing difficulty. A player can customize the car to suit their style and unlock new ones in arcade mode. The game features nitrous, similar to that of other racing games. This can be particularly useful when the player is behind an opponent or behind time; the AI can use nitrous oxide as well.The game system was developed at the same time as Need for Speed: Underground (which was released first and is inspired by the Shutokō Battle series),[citation needed] but the racing styles are realistic, similar to PlayStation's Gran Turismo. Damage is distinctively visible in Juiced, and must be repaired before the player can tune up the car.The game went to number 1 in the UK MCV Charts and the first version sold 2.5 million units across the various skus.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Big Kahuna Reef is a tile-matching puzzle video game created by Reflexive Entertainment. Released in 2004 on the PC, it became the first of a series of Big Kahuna titles. The look of the game is that of ocean scenes, exotic fish and tiki heads.It is a match-making casual game that involves breaking boxes in order to progress past each level. To beat a level a player must break all the boxes by making chains of objects (such as starfish or shells). Between levels, points are earned that unlock new fish and other undersea creatures. During the interludes between levels, one can create and observe their personal reef and its creatures. Reflexive also created a sequel called Big Kahuna Reef 2 in addition to a title called Big Kahuna Words in which the game play mechanic is similar to the other two titles, but instead of busting boxes with chains of similar objects, one must make words (akin to the game Boggle).There are thousands of additional free user-created levels created by people from around the world (similar to the Ricochet Infinity series).</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Rhythm Tengoku (リズム天国, Rizumu Tengoku, lit. Rhythm Heaven) is a rhythm game developed by Nintendo SPD and published by Nintendo. It was released on August 3, 2006, and was the last game developed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. An arcade version of the game was reprogrammed and published by Sega on September 20, 2007. Both versions were released in Japan exclusively. A sequel was released for the Nintendo DS titled Rhythm Heaven which was released in Japan, North America, Australia, and Europe (the latter which was titled Rhythm Paradise). Its most recent release was for the Wii titled Rhythm Heaven Fever. It began as an idea created by its composer and supervisor Tsunku who proposed it to Nintendo due to his belief that they could do a better job with it than he could.Rhythm Tengoku's gameplay focuses on audio cues rather than visual cues to convey information to players. It features a number of unique stages which have their own type of rhythm and gameplay. Players follow the rhythm until the end where they are given a score based on their performance. The gameplay and music were both well received by critics and consumers. Parallels have been drawn between it and the developer's previous work on the WarioWare series.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Simpsons Game is an action/platformer video game based on the animated television series The Simpsons and loosely on the film, made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by Simpsons writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.The game follows the five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.Video game critics gave the game a mixed to positive reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.Xbox and GameCube versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled.

    <ns2:abstract>The Simpsons Game is an action/platformer video game based on the animated television series The Simpsons and loosely on the film, made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by Simpsons writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.The game follows the five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.Video game critics gave the game a mixed to positive reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.Xbox and GameCube versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled. This is possibly due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Madden NFL 97 is the first Madden NFL football game to be created in the 32-bit gaming era. It was originally created for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, but other versions were also released, including the 16 bit Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis.This was the first edition of Madden to implement the use of a salary cap when customizing team rosters. It also featured the new Baltimore Ravens, the expansion franchise that absorbed the roster of the Cleveland Browns for the 1996 season. The game also adds a team of real free agents (as opposed to the blank slate used in Madden 96) which can be traded and added to other teams' rosters (led by recently semi-retired quarterback Randall Cunningham), and could be played by using a cheat code.Classic teams were once again used, although most were different from the previous year's teams; the years ranged as far back as 1952 (Detroit Lions) and as recent as 1990 (Buffalo Bills). Jacksonville and Carolina, once again, did not get classic teams, but Baltimore was attached to a classic Cleveland Browns team.The best team in the overall ranking, with a score of 85 was the Dallas Cowboys and the worst team with a score of 62 was the Baltimore Ravens. The best ranked offenses were between the Cowboys and the Lions with a score of 92. The St. Louis Rams had the best ranked defense with an 86.

    <ns2:abstract>The Sailor Moon video games were released in Japan during the height of the media franchise's popularity. By 1998, twenty games were released. The games released as of 1995, each had sales figures of about 200,000 to 300,000. They have never been released in any other country, with the single exception of the Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon game developed by Angel, which was released in France in 1994. The games are hard to find in any other country unless downloaded from the internet as ROMs.Bandai produced a small number of Sailor Moon games, but the majority were handled by a Japanese game company called Angel. Early games were side-scrolling fighters, whereas later games were unique puzzle games, and even later titles chose to go a versus fighting game style. Another Story was the only game to stand out, being a role-playing video game. Panic in Nakayoshi World was also released, an overhead Adventures of Lolo-style puzzle game featuring characters from various Nakayoshi-printed manga. Sailor Moon and Chibi Moon are playable characters.The games mainly saw release on the Super Famicom, with the first side-scroller being ported to the Mega Drive. A separate arcade side-scrolling fighter was also released. In addition, two side-scrolling adventure games were produced for the Game Boy (Sailormoon and Sailormoon R), and a side-scrolling game was also produced for the Game Gear (Sailormoon S).The first versus fighting game from the series was released for the 3DO. However, as the 3DO did not sell well outside of Japan, this game has gone largely unnoticed. Produced by Bandai themselves as opposed to Angel for the other two, this game is considerably different. A final versus fighting game was released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.The last Sailor Moon-related game to date was released in November 2001 - Happy Chibiusa World.A game was released in the U.S. for the PC. It was a minigame compilation titled The 3D Adventures of Sailor Moon. Aside from the theme, the games did nothing to tie in to the series.On July 15, 2010, Bandai Namco Games Europe announced development of a new Sailor Moon video game for Nintendo DS, Sailor Moon: La Luna Splende, an adventure game featuring environmental puzzles that takes place in Molly/Naru's dreams.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold is a live-action laserdisc video game produced by American Laser Games, released for the arcade, Sega CD, 3DO, CD-i and DOS, the first release being in 1992; the quality of the video is the lowest on Sega CD. A sequel to the moderately popular Mad Dog McCree, the game abandoned the rather simple style of the original, introducing elements that can be considered "Hollywood", including dynamic shootout scenes and in-game music, as opposed to the original's almost complete lack thereof. Like the first game, the player follows the storyline and is required to quickly shoot certain enemies to proceed on the quest. The game was re-released by Digital Leisure in 2003 on DVD-Video and again in 2009 on the Wii as part of the Mad Dog McCree Gunslinger Pack, a compilation that also includes the first Mad Dog game as well as The Last Bounty Hunter.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Avalon Hill's Advanced Civilization is a computer edition of the Advanced Civilization board game (the Civilization board game including the expansion to that game called Advanced Civilization). Both the board and computer game portray the same basic concept: the players manage ancient Mediterranean civilizations in an effort to move them from the early Bronze Age to beyond the Iron Age. It was published in 1995, shortly before Avalon Hill was bought out by Hasbro in 1998.[citation needed] It came out about the same time that Sid Meier's Civilization II was released, and as a result, didn't do well commercially.[citation needed] The game was also slightly hobbled in that it was developed for MS-DOS, so while it ran from Windows 95, it ran as a DOS application.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge, known as Rockman World (ロックマンワールド, Rokkuman Wārudo) in Japan, is a platform video game by Capcom for the Nintendo Game Boy. It is the first game in the handheld series of the Mega Man franchise. It was first released in Japan on July 26, 1991 and was localized in North America that December and in Europe the following year. The game continues the adventures of the android hero Mega Man as he once again confronts the evil Dr. Wily, who has recently dispatched his revived "Robot Masters" and a new "Mega Man Killer" named Enker.Dr. Wily's Revenge is an action and platform game in same vein as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games. The player is tasked with completing a series of four stages in any order desired. Beating a stage's boss will earn the player a special weapon that can be selected at will and used throughout the rest of the game. Dr. Wily's Revenge specifically takes components of the original Mega Man and Mega Man 2, including their enemies, stage aesthetics, and Robot Masters.According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was the first Mega Man game to be outsourced to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 is a 2008 real-time strategy video game developed by EA Los Angeles and published by Electronic Arts. It was released on October 28, 2008 in the United States for Microsoft Windows PCs and October 30, 2008 in Europe. An Xbox 360 version was released on November 11. On January 21, 2009 EA officially announced Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Ultimate Edition, the PlayStation 3 version which contains bonus material extra to that of the Xbox 360 and PC versions and released on March 23, 2009 along with the Mac OS version by TransGaming. The game is a continuation of the Red Alert games within the Command &amp; Conquer series. Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 – Uprising, a stand-alone expansion pack, was released for Windows in March 2009. It was offered via digital distribution.Like the previous entries in the Red Alert series, the game is set in an alternate reality from World War II, in which the Western Allies fought the Soviet Union. In Red Alert 3 the Soviet leadership, facing defeat, goes back in time to kill Albert Einstein and prevent his assistance to the allies, paving the way for Soviet domination in the present. However as an unintended consequence, a third world power, the Empire of the Rising Sun, is created and all three sides go to war. All three factions are playable, with the gameplay involving constructing a base, gathering resources and training armies to defeat other players. Each faction has a fully co-operative campaign, playable with an artificial intelligence partner or with another human player online. The game intersperses strategy missions with full motion video footage featuring an ensemble cast led by Jonathan Pryce, Tim Curry and George Takei as the leaders of the three adversaries.The game received mostly positive reviews, with reviewers citing the co-operative and multiplayer components as strengths, along with the enhanced role of naval combat compared to other real-time strategy games. Commonly cited weaknesses included aspects such as unit pathfinding.</ns2:abstract>

The game serves as an epilogue to The Amazing Spider-Man film.The Nintendo 3DS and Wii version feature a different, more linear game with the same script and plot.

It was natively designed for the 3DS, and later ported to the Wii. Beenox also developed this version.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Agatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun is a video game released for the PC and Nintendo Wii, and is the third installment of The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series, developed by AWE Productions, based on Agatha Christie's novel Evil Under the Sun. The game was released in October 2007.Evil Under The Sun features Hercule Poirot as the protagonist, unlike the previous game in the series, Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express, which had featured Poirot as a non-playable character. It also features numerous improvements and expanded gameplay elements, with a new inventory system, dialogue choices, and more environments. While players take the role of Poirot, they are actually playing as Captain Hastings playing as Poirot, in an interactive scenario designed by Poirot in order to allow his long-time friend a chance to solve the mystery in the way Poirot would.The game's plot follows Poirot as he investigates the murder of a noted actress on an island. It is divided into two sections: story-time, in which Poirot uncovers the secrets of Seadrift Island and real-time, in Poirot's office in London in which the player, as Captain Hastings, can request hints, review information and consult the locations of the suspects on a wall map.Despite the fact that the murderer remains the same, new plot aspects are included, such as new characters, a slight change of location, and the fact that Hastings becomes a part of the plot. Poirot's voice is performed by actor Kevin Delaney.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Ōkami (Japanese: 大神, literally "great god", "great spirit" or "wolf" if written as 狼) is an action-adventure video game developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom. It was released for Sony's PlayStation 2 video game console in 2006 in Japan and North America, and 2007 in Europe and Australia. Despite the closure of Clover Studio a few months after the game's initial release, a version for Nintendo's Wii console was developed and produced by Ready at Dawn, Tose and Capcom, which was released in North America in April 2008, in Europe in June 2008, and in Japan in October 2009.Set sometime in classical Japanese history, Ōkami combines several Japanese myths, legends and folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess, named Amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf. It features a distinct sumi-e-inspired cel-shaded visual style and the Celestial Brush, a gesture-system to perform miracles.Ōkami was one of the last PlayStation 2 games selected for release prior to the release of the PlayStation 3. Although it suffered from poor sales, Ōkami received critical acclaim, earning the title of IGN's 2006 Game of the Year. The Wii version has earned similar praise though the motion control scheme has received mixed reviews.A high-definition port of the game was released on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network in October 2012 and for retail in Japan in November 2012, supporting the use of the PlayStation Move motion controller. A sequel for the Nintendo DS titled Ōkamiden was released in Japan in September 2010, followed by North America and Europe in March 2011.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Simpsons Game is an action/platformer video game based on the animated television series The Simpsons and loosely on the film, made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by Simpsons writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.The game follows the five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.Video game critics gave the game a mixed to positive reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.Xbox and GameCube versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled. This is possibly due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Madden NFL 97 is the first Madden NFL football game to be created in the 32-bit gaming era. It was originally created for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, but other versions were also released, including the 16 bit Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis.This was the first edition of Madden to implement the use of a salary cap when customizing team rosters. It also featured the new Baltimore Ravens, the expansion franchise that absorbed the roster of the Cleveland Browns for the 1996 season. The game also adds a team of real free agents (as opposed to the blank slate used in Madden 96) which can be traded and added to other teams' rosters (led by recently semi-retired quarterback Randall Cunningham), and could be played by using a cheat code.Classic teams were once again used, although most were different from the previous year's teams; the years ranged as far back as 1952 (Detroit Lions) and as recent as 1990 (Buffalo Bills). Jacksonville and Carolina, once again, did not get classic teams, but Baltimore was attached to a classic Cleveland Browns team.The best team in the overall ranking, with a score of 85 was the Dallas Cowboys and the worst team with a score of 62 was the Baltimore Ravens. The best ranked offenses were between the Cowboys and the Lions with a score of 92. The St. Louis Rams had the best ranked defense with an 86. The Miami Dolphins had the best ranked special teams with a 93.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Vampire Hunter D is a PlayStation video game based on the series of books and movies of the same name. Along with Countdown Vampires, it is one of the few survival horror games to revolve around vampires. The gameplay is similar to the earlier games in the Resident Evil series; because characters are fully polygonal, whereas the backgrounds are pre-rendered. The story of the game is similar to that of the second movie, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (which, in turn, is based on the third novel). Essentially, D, a Dhampir (transliterated as Dunpeal) vampire hunter is hired by an old man named Elbourne to save his daughter Charlotte, who was kidnapped by a vampire, Meier Link. If his daughter was already transformed into a vampire, then D should kill her humanely. Also, Elbourne's son hired a team of human vampire hunters known as the Marcus Brothers to serve as backup. There are though, some differences between the game and the movie.Only two of the Barbarois mutants (Benge and Mashira) appear as enemies, Caroline being not featured. Borgoff and Leila were the only members of the Marcus brothers which were notably featured; Kyle, Nolt, and Grove just make some cameos in cutscenes, and later are found dead. There are 3 possible endings based on your actions in-game, 1 of which is similar to the end of the film. The game shares some of the voice actors of the film.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Sacrifice is a real-time strategy video game published by Interplay Entertainment in 2000 for the Windows 98 platform. Developed by Shiny Entertainment the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. Impressing reviewers with its graphics, Sacrifice was the first commercial video game to make full use of video graphics cards that can process transform, clipping, and lighting instructions. The game was ported to Mac OS 9.2 in 2001.Unlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, Sacrifice places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana—energy for casting spells—constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.Sacrifice was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses tessellation: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, Sacrifice can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as Tim Curry, and the musical compositions of Kevin Manthei. Sacrifice was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw. Despite winning several awards, Sacrifice was not a commercial success, and no sequels are planned.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Project Eden is an action-adventure game developed by Core Design and published Eidos Interactive for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2. Players switch between control of four UPA (Urban Protection Agency) agents, each with their own special abilities, as they work their way through a city that has grown upward and upward, leaving delving buildings and neighborhoods "below city limits". Among other unique mechanics of Project Eden is the fact that player characters do not die; instead, they are respawned at the last checkpoint, where their health is fully restored. With its emphasis on puzzle-solving over combat, the game may be thought of as a cyberpunk updating of The Lost Vikings, as it has more in common with that game developed by Blizzard Entertainment than traditional first- or third-person shooters. A single player can control any of the four characters at any given time, and other players can jump in at any time and assume control of team members.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Advent Rising is an action-adventure third-person shooter video game developed by GlyphX Games and published by Majesco Entertainment. The game was released on May 31, 2005 for Xbox and on August 9, 2005 for Microsoft Windows. Its story was created by Donald Mustard and featured a script written by science fiction writers Orson Scott Card and Cameron Dayton; the full orchestral soundtrack was done by Tommy Tallarico. As of September 14, 2006, Steam began offering Advent Rising for download.Much hyped Advent Rising was the first in a planned trilogy which also saw the development of a game that would take place alongside Advent Rising, called Advent Shadow for the PSP. Despite a large advertising campaign including promotion in cinemas, the game's retail performance fell far short of expectations. By the end of 2005, Majesco had completely revised its business plan to focus towards handheld games and canceled plans for future Advent Rising games.A five-issue spin-off comic book series was produced and ran from October 2005 to November 2006. Plans for novel tie-ins by Orson Scott Card never came to fruition. In June 2006, Donald Mustard posted a statement on the website of his new venture, Chair Entertainment, stating that he "would be happy to finish the Advent series if the opportunity presented itself", but confirmed he does not currently hold the rights to do so. In 2008, Novint announced they are adding Novint Falcon support to this game and will sell it as Ascension Reborn for the Novint Falcon only.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine is a multi-platform action-adventure video game by LucasArts released in late 1999. The first 3D installment in the series, its gameplay focuses on solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and various platforming sections. The story told is set between the events of Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,and puts the eponymous protagonist, the adventurer Indiana Jones, against the Soviet Union. In a race for a mythological Babylonian power source, he joins forces with the Central Intelligence Agency and collects four pieces of the Infernal Machine, a biblical device that allegedly opens a portal to another dimension.The title was designed, written, and directed by Hal Barwood who considered the Indiana Jones franchise a perfect fit for the action-adventure genre. Initially developed for the Windows 95 and 98 operating systems, the game later received an enhanced Nintendo 64 port jointly developed with Factor 5, as well as a 2D version for the Game Boy Color created by HotGen. Infernal Machine received generally favorable reviews, having been praised for its detailed storyline and sophisticated level designs, though widely criticized for its unwieldy control scheme.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software. Originally released on May 5, 1992, for the PC operating system MS-DOS, the game was inspired by the 1980s Muse Software video games Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein. A promotional version of Wolfenstein 3D was released as shareware, which permitted it to be copied widely. The game was later ported to a wide range of computer systems and video game consoles.The shareware release contains one episode consisting of ten levels. The commercial release consists of three episodes, which include the shareware episode and two subsequent episodes. Later releases included a three-episode mission pack titled The Nocturnal Missions. The player assumes the role of a World War II Allied spy William "B.J." Blazkowicz, who is trying to escape from Castle Wolfenstein, a Nazi German prison. After the initial escape episode, Blazkowicz carries out a series of missions against the Nazis.Wolfenstein 3D was a critical and commercial success. It is widely regarded as having helped popularize the genre on the PC and having established the basic run-and-gun archetype for many subsequent first-person shooter games.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart's Super Off Road is an arcade video game released in 1989 by Leland Corporation. The game was endorsed by professional off road racer Ivan Stewart. Virgin Games produced several home versions in 1990. In 1991, an NES version was later released by Leland's Tradewest subsidiary followed by versions for most major home formats, including NES, Sega Genesis, SNES, Amiga and MS-DOS.</ns2:abstract>
    <ns2:abstract>Super ZZT is the successor to ZZT, created by Allen Pilgrim and Tim Sweeney of Epic Games (then Epic MegaGames). Like its predecessor, Super ZZT was essentially a game creation system with a few games packaged with it, which included Lost Forest, Monster Zoo, and Proving Grounds. Like ZZT, the greatest draw to its sequel was the level editor which allowed players to create their own games. The editor itself was somewhat "hidden" by the creators, perhaps because it was not quite as polished as they wanted in time for the release. It was necessary to add the argument /e to the command line when loading Super ZZT, and then to press E to enter the editor.Some changes to this version include floor textures, new prefabricated enemies and objects, and scrolling maps, allowing for much larger worlds than ZZT would allow. Although Super ZZT is in many ways a vast improvement over ZZT, it never caught on with the ZZT community like the original ZZT did, and very few games were ever created for Super ZZT. However, notable game creation group Interactive Fantasies did create 3 Super ZZT games.</ns2:abstract>

Each user was represented by a persona which they assembled using INN's built-in 'facemaker'. The facemaker was incredibly detailed, with enough different options to construct over 84 million unique personas. Users could then indicate their level of skill in various games, in order to encourage fair match-making between players, and a short list of hobbies to help match interests with new friends.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run is an action-adventure video game based on the animated sitcom The Simpsons. It was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Microsoft Windows in North America on September 16, 2003, in Europe on October 31, 2003 and in Japan on December 25, 2003. The story and dialogue were crafted by writers from The Simpsons, with all character voices supplied by the actual cast.The game follows the Simpson family and the citizens of Springfield, who witness many strange incidents that occur in Springfield. When several of the citizens take matters into their own hands, they discover that two aliens Kang and Kodos are filming a reality television series about the populace. To make the show more interesting, the aliens release a new version of the popular soft drink Buzz Cola into Springfield's water supply—however, this particular version causes insanity. With help from Professor Frink, Homer is able to destroy the aliens' spaceship, and Springfield and its inhabitants are returned to normal.The game received generally favorable reviews from video game critics. Praise focused on the interpretation of the Simpsons television series as a video game and its parodical take on Grand Theft Auto III, while criticism mostly surrounded some aspects of gameplay. The game received the award for Fave Video Game at the 2004 Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards. As of June 2007, over three million copies of the game had been sold.</ns2:abstract>

The game is inspired by the spy thriller genre (notably the James Bond film series). Similarly to Dungeon Keeper, the game turns the traditional plotline on its head, with the player acting as the villain, evading the comically stereotyped forces of justice. Gameplay revolves around the player building an island fortress and achieving clichéd world domination, much like most films.Since 2 March 2006, the intellectual property rights of the game are owned by Rebellion Developments.On 8 August 2013, Rebellion Developments announced via their official Twitter account that there is an online game in the works titled Evil Genius Online. It is currently in open beta as a Facebook game.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Darkman was developed by Twilight and published by Ocean Software in 1991. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name.In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Firebug was a 1982 computer game by MUSE Software for the Apple II computer. The game was released on cassette tape and on floppy disk. It was written by Silas Warner, whose most famous accomplishment was Castle Wolfenstein.The player controlled a "firebug", a 3-by-3-pixel square with a tail stretching behind it. The player picked up gas cans—each represented by a single pixel on the screen—and dropped a can by pressing the joystick button. The end of the player's tail glowed white, and ignited any gas can that it came adjacent to, including cans the player had dropped. Once a gas can ignited, it burst into colorful flames, which ignited any walls they touch.The goal was to burn down the highest possible percentage of the walls on the level, and escape down the stairs to the next level without touching any flames with the body of the firebug. Tail collisions with fire were expected and ignored. As the game progressed, each level featured tighter mazes of walls, increasing the penalty for player mistakes; and the player's tail shortened, causing player-dropped gas cans to explode sooner.Firebug used the Apple II's lo-res graphics mode, which displayed 16 colors but which had a pixel resolution of only 40 wide by 48 high. Hence, the game looked remarkably crude, even by the standards of Apple II games. At the time, the colorful fire effect was notable.The game was an inspiration for Pyro 2.Firebug was not critically well received.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Neon Genesis Evangelion 2 (新世紀エヴァンゲリオン2, lit. "Shinseiki Evangelion 2") is a Japanese video game for the PlayStation 2 developed by Alfa System and published by Bandai. It has role-playing video game and world-controlling elements, and allows the player to follow a number of characters (such as Asuka Langley Soryu, Shinji Ikari, Pen², etc.) through multiple versions of the main plot of the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. The PlayStation Portable port was released 2006-04-27 as Neon Genesis Evangelion 2 -Another Cases-.The 24 topics were named in total "Classified Information" (Kimitsu Jouhou). The topics considerably expand upon the back-story: Adam and Lilith are settlers sent to Earth in what would become Earth's moon by a "First Ancestral Race", with "Seeds" and Spears of Longinus. The various Angels seek out the Black Moon of Lilith because they are seeking Lilith, or Adam; and so on. While the information seems to have been based on extensive interviews with Hideaki Anno, creator of the franchise, the canonicity of the information in the game has never been officially stated. Besides the additional information, Neon Genesis Evangelion 2 also introduced a number of additions like F-type Equipment and the final products of the Jet Alone project (as in some storylines, the A HUMAN WORK episode does not end in the cancellation of the Jet Alone project).</ns2:abstract>

The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

It was developed to be released in Japan, North America, and Europe for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was released on February 21, 2012 in North America and February 24, 2012 in Europe.The game follows the titular character, the demigod Asura as he seeks revenge on the other pantheon of demigods who betrayed him. The story is presented in the style and format of an episodic series of cinematic shorts, including opening and closing credits, with the gameplay being integrated into the cinematic where players switch between third-person combat and interactive sequences with player input in the form of quick-time event button prompts. Because of its unique style, the game has been described in the media as an "interactive anime". According to the game's producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, Asura's Wrath takes elements from Hinduism and Buddhism and blends them with science fiction, with the main character based on the ever combative and superiority-seeking beings of the same name that are part of the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology.</ns2:abstract>

It was released in Japan in March 2012 for arcades, and on July 26, 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. It is the second region locked game on PlayStation 3. While released in the same year in in North America, the European version was released in 2013. During the game, the player controls a user of a being called a Persona that has access to multiple type of attacks and is pitted against other Persona-users.The console versions added a story mode that expands the plot from the arcade version. The game takes place two months after the events of Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 and features characters from both that game and Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3. The plot focuses on a fighting tournament named "P-1 Grand Prix" starting in a dimension known as the Midnight Channel where characters from the Persona series are forced to fight each other using their Personas in order to progress and find the host. The main composer is Shoji Meguro and the music includes both new and rearranged themes.Atlus requested Arc System Works' collaboration to make Persona 4 Arena with the former handling the story and the latter the gameplay. Persona 4 Arena became one of the fastest selling fighting games in Japan with 90% of its stock sold in its debut week. Reviews for the game have been positive with critics praising the gameplay and graphics employed while the length of the story mode was criticized. A sequel, titled Persona 4 Arena Ultimax was later released, featuring new characters and abilities.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Serious Sam II (or Serious Sam 2) is a science fiction first-person shooter video game released for the PC and Xbox and the sequel to the 2002 computer game Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, making it the third game in the Serious Sam series. It was designed and developed by Croteam and was released on October 11, 2005. The game was initially published by 2K Games, a Take-Two Interactive subsidiary. The game was later made available on Steam on January 31, 2012. While the game was originally released only for Windows and the Xbox, a Linux version of the game client and the game's content editor, Serious Editor 2, was later released and is in beta.In the single-player campaign, the player assumes the role of hero Sam "Serious" Stone in his adventures against the forces of the extraterrestrial overlord, "Mental", who seeks to destroy humanity. Taking place after the events of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, Sam travels through various worlds collecting parts of a medallion in an effort to defeat Mental. He is guided by the Sirian Great Council and receives sporadic aid from the natives of the worlds he visits. The multiplayer mode includes online co-op and deathmatch, the latter having been introduced in a patch. A 4.5/5.0 was awarded to Serious Sam by Computer Gaming World, though overall the game received moderate praise from the media, earning an average of 75% on Game Rankings.Croteam simultaneously developed Serious Engine 2, the successor to their previous game engine, Serious Engine, for use in the game, and the engine is capable of many features of other advanced game engines of the time including high dynamic range rendering and light bloom. The engine supports integration with both Xfire and GameSpy Arcade for multiplayer match finding. Serious Sam II is the only game so far to use the proprietary engine, though the Serious Engine II is available for licensing.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back is a computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace) as a sequel to their 1985 title Cauldron. The two-dimensional (2D) platform game was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a bouncing pumpkin that is on a quest of vengeance against the "Witch Queen". The roles of the two were reversed from the first game, in which the witch defeated a monster pumpkin.Following the success of Cauldron, Palace employee Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.Cauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64. It was released in the following years on other systems and as re-releases. The game received praise, mainly for its audio-visuals, in video game magazines. Difficulty in handling the bouncing pumpkin's movement was a common complaint, although reviewers felt the overall package was of good value.</ns2:abstract>

The game was subsequently published by Krisalis Software for the Acorn Archimedes. Virgin Interactive published the game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Master System, and the Sega Game Gear. Sony Imagesoft published the game for the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo SNES, and Game Boy.In 1994, the game was among the most popular games for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. The character of Chuck Rock himself was an iconic early character for Core Design before the introduction of Lara Croft in the 1996 game Tomb Raider, and the character of Chuck Rock himself and his family even featured in some UK comic books of the 1990s.Chuck Rock spawned two other video game sequels.</ns2:abstract>
    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure.

The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>
    <ns2:abstract>Cauldron is a two-dimensional (2D) shoot 'em up/platformer computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace). The game was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a witch, who aims to become the "Witch Queen" by defeating an enemy called the "Pumpking".Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron originated as licensed video game of the horror film Halloween. Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized that there were no technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.The game received praise from video game magazines, who focused on the graphics and two different modes of play. A common complaint was Cauldron's excessive difficulty. The following year, Palace released a direct sequel titled Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Darkman was developed by Twilight and published by Ocean Software in 1991. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name.In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Simpsons Game is an action/platformer video game based on the animated television series The Simpsons and loosely on the film, made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by Simpsons writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.The game follows the five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.Video game critics gave the game a mixed to positive reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.Xbox and GameCube versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled. This is possibly due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.</ns2:abstract>

Crytek, the developers of the original game, were not involved in the development of Far Cry 2. It is the second installment of the main Far Cry series.Ubisoft has marketed Far Cry 2 as the true sequel to Far Cry, however the sequel has very few noticeable similarities to the original game. Instead, it features completely new characters and setting, as well as a new style of gameplay that allows the player greater freedom to explore different African landscapes such as deserts, jungles, and savannas. The game takes place in a modern-day Central African nation in a state of anarchy and civil war. The player takes control of a mercenary on a lengthy journey to locate and assassinate "The Jackal", a notorious gun runner. As of January 23, 2009, the game has sold 2.9 million copies.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Temple of Elemental Evil is a 2003 role-playing video game by now-defunct Troika Games. It is a re-creation of the classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure of the same name using the 3.5 edition rules. This is the only video game to take place in the Greyhawk campaign setting and the first video game to implement the 3.5 edition rule set. The game was published by Atari, who then held the interactive rights of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise. The Temple of Elemental Evil was released in autumn of 2003.The release was criticized for stability issues and other bugs. The turn-based tactical combat, however, was generally thought to be implemented well, and is arguably the most faithful representation of the then-current tabletop role-playing game ("3.5e") rules in a video game. This game still has a very active fanbase, with many improvements and bugfixes added.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Madden NFL 97 is the first Madden NFL football game to be created in the 32-bit gaming era. It was originally created for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, but other versions were also released, including the 16 bit Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis.This was the first edition of Madden to implement the use of a salary cap when customizing team rosters. It also featured the new Baltimore Ravens, the expansion franchise that absorbed the roster of the Cleveland Browns for the 1996 season. The game also adds a team of real free agents (as opposed to the blank slate used in Madden 96) which can be traded and added to other teams' rosters (led by recently semi-retired quarterback Randall Cunningham), and could be played by using a cheat code.Classic teams were once again used, although most were different from the previous year's teams; the years ranged as far back as 1952 (Detroit Lions) and as recent as 1990 (Buffalo Bills). Jacksonville and Carolina, once again, did not get classic teams, but Baltimore was attached to a classic Cleveland Browns team.The best team in the overall ranking, with a score of 85 was the Dallas Cowboys and the worst team with a score of 62 was the Baltimore Ravens. The best ranked offenses were between the Cowboys and the Lions with a score of 92. The St. Louis Rams had the best ranked defense with an 86. The Miami Dolphins had the best ranked special teams with a 93.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Rhythm Tengoku (リズム天国, Rizumu Tengoku, lit. Rhythm Heaven) is a rhythm game developed by Nintendo SPD and published by Nintendo. It was released on August 3, 2006, and was the last game developed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. An arcade version of the game was reprogrammed and published by Sega on September 20, 2007. Both versions were released in Japan exclusively. A sequel was released for the Nintendo DS titled Rhythm Heaven which was released in Japan, North America, Australia, and Europe (the latter which was titled Rhythm Paradise). Its most recent release was for the Wii titled Rhythm Heaven Fever. It began as an idea created by its composer and supervisor Tsunku who proposed it to Nintendo due to his belief that they could do a better job with it than he could.Rhythm Tengoku's gameplay focuses on audio cues rather than visual cues to convey information to players. It features a number of unique stages which have their own type of rhythm and gameplay. Players follow the rhythm until the end where they are given a score based on their performance. The gameplay and music were both well received by critics and consumers. Parallels have been drawn between it and the developer's previous work on the WarioWare series.</ns2:abstract>

Despite the Cyberathlete Professional League announcing that it was ceasing tournament operations on 13 March 2008, and then being acquired by an investment group based in the United Arab Emirates on 25 August 2008, Tom Mustaine, the director of Escalation Studios, said that the studio would continue to work on Severity, although it was not their main focus at the time. Angel Munoz, founder of the Cyberathlete Professional League, confirmed in an October 2009 interview that production on Severity had ended because no publisher had shown interest.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>ViOS (Visual Internet Operating System) was a client-server software system designed by Julian Lombardi in the mid-1990s and built by a team he led at ViOS Inc. from 1999-2001 as a way of spatially organizing all Internet-deliverable resources (including web pages) into a massively scaled multiuser 3D environment with users of the system represented as customizable avatars. The basic concept behind the "ViOS 3D Internet Viewer" was to take the virtual world of the entire Internet and adapt it to a physical representation of large virtual landscape, complete with mountains, rivers and cities. This approach was taken because of the belief that virtual landscapes resembling our physical world are more conducive to exploration and social interaction than the flat and abstracted world of the current document-based Internet.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Darkman was developed by Twilight and published by Ocean Software in 1991. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name.In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back is a computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace) as a sequel to their 1985 title Cauldron. The two-dimensional (2D) platform game was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a bouncing pumpkin that is on a quest of vengeance against the "Witch Queen". The roles of the two were reversed from the first game, in which the witch defeated a monster pumpkin.Following the success of Cauldron, Palace employee Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.Cauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64. It was released in the following years on other systems and as re-releases. The game received praise, mainly for its audio-visuals, in video game magazines. Difficulty in handling the bouncing pumpkin's movement was a common complaint, although reviewers felt the overall package was of good value.</ns2:abstract>
    <ns2:abstract>Cauldron is a two-dimensional (2D) shoot 'em up/platformer computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace). The game was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a witch, who aims to become the "Witch Queen" by defeating an enemy called the "Pumpking".Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron originated as licensed video game of the horror film Halloween. Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized that there were no technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.The game received praise from video game magazines, who focused on the graphics and two different modes of play. A common complaint was Cauldron's excessive difficulty. The following year, Palace released a direct sequel titled Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Sailor Moon video games were released in Japan during the height of the media franchise's popularity. By 1998, twenty games were released. The games released as of 1995, each had sales figures of about 200,000 to 300,000. They have never been released in any other country, with the single exception of the Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon game developed by Angel, which was released in France in 1994. The games are hard to find in any other country unless downloaded from the internet as ROMs.Bandai produced a small number of Sailor Moon games, but the majority were handled by a Japanese game company called Angel. Early games were side-scrolling fighters, whereas later games were unique puzzle games, and even later titles chose to go a versus fighting game style. Another Story was the only game to stand out, being a role-playing video game. Panic in Nakayoshi World was also released, an overhead Adventures of Lolo-style puzzle game featuring characters from various Nakayoshi-printed manga. Sailor Moon and Chibi Moon are playable characters.The games mainly saw release on the Super Famicom, with the first side-scroller being ported to the Mega Drive. A separate arcade side-scrolling fighter was also released. In addition, two side-scrolling adventure games were produced for the Game Boy (Sailormoon and Sailormoon R), and a side-scrolling game was also produced for the Game Gear (Sailormoon S).The first versus fighting game from the series was released for the 3DO. However, as the 3DO did not sell well outside of Japan, this game has gone largely unnoticed. Produced by Bandai themselves as opposed to Angel for the other two, this game is considerably different. A final versus fighting game was released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.The last Sailor Moon-related game to date was released in November 2001 - Happy Chibiusa World.A game was released in the U.S. for the PC. It was a minigame compilation titled The 3D Adventures of Sailor Moon. Aside from the theme, the games did nothing to tie in to the series.On July 15, 2010, Bandai Namco Games Europe announced development of a new Sailor Moon video game for Nintendo DS, Sailor Moon: La Luna Splende, an adventure game featuring environmental puzzles that takes place in Molly/Naru's dreams.</ns2:abstract>

The game also adds a team of real free agents (as opposed to the blank slate used in Madden 96) which can be traded and added to other teams' rosters (led by recently semi-retired quarterback Randall Cunningham), and could be played by using a cheat code.Classic teams were once again used, although most were different from the previous year's teams; the years ranged as far back as 1952 (Detroit Lions) and as recent as 1990 (Buffalo Bills). Jacksonville and Carolina, once again, did not get classic teams, but Baltimore was attached to a classic Cleveland Browns team.The best team in the overall ranking, with a score of 85 was the Dallas Cowboys and the worst team with a score of 62 was the Baltimore Ravens. The best ranked offenses were between the Cowboys and the Lions with a score of 92. The St. Louis Rams had the best ranked defense with an 86. The Miami Dolphins had the best ranked special teams with a 93.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Asura's Wrath (アスラズ ラース, Asurazu Rāsu) is an action video game collaboration between CyberConnect2 and Capcom that was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show in 2010. It was developed to be released in Japan, North America, and Europe for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was released on February 21, 2012 in North America and February 24, 2012 in Europe.The game follows the titular character, the demigod Asura as he seeks revenge on the other pantheon of demigods who betrayed him. The story is presented in the style and format of an episodic series of cinematic shorts, including opening and closing credits, with the gameplay being integrated into the cinematic where players switch between third-person combat and interactive sequences with player input in the form of quick-time event button prompts. Because of its unique style, the game has been described in the media as an "interactive anime". According to the game's producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, Asura's Wrath takes elements from Hinduism and Buddhism and blends them with science fiction, with the main character based on the ever combative and superiority-seeking beings of the same name that are part of the Hindu and Buddhist cosmology.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Sailor Moon video games were released in Japan during the height of the media franchise's popularity. By 1998, twenty games were released. The games released as of 1995, each had sales figures of about 200,000 to 300,000. They have never been released in any other country, with the single exception of the Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon game developed by Angel, which was released in France in 1994. The games are hard to find in any other country unless downloaded from the internet as ROMs.Bandai produced a small number of Sailor Moon games, but the majority were handled by a Japanese game company called Angel. Early games were side-scrolling fighters, whereas later games were unique puzzle games, and even later titles chose to go a versus fighting game style. Another Story was the only game to stand out, being a role-playing video game. Panic in Nakayoshi World was also released, an overhead Adventures of Lolo-style puzzle game featuring characters from various Nakayoshi-printed manga. Sailor Moon and Chibi Moon are playable characters.The games mainly saw release on the Super Famicom, with the first side-scroller being ported to the Mega Drive. A separate arcade side-scrolling fighter was also released. In addition, two side-scrolling adventure games were produced for the Game Boy (Sailormoon and Sailormoon R), and a side-scrolling game was also produced for the Game Gear (Sailormoon S).The first versus fighting game from the series was released for the 3DO. However, as the 3DO did not sell well outside of Japan, this game has gone largely unnoticed. Produced by Bandai themselves as opposed to Angel for the other two, this game is considerably different. A final versus fighting game was released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.The last Sailor Moon-related game to date was released in November 2001 - Happy Chibiusa World.A game was released in the U.S. for the PC. It was a minigame compilation titled The 3D Adventures of Sailor Moon. Aside from the theme, the games did nothing to tie in to the series.On July 15, 2010, Bandai Namco Games Europe announced development of a new Sailor Moon video game for Nintendo DS, Sailor Moon: La Luna Splende, an adventure game featuring environmental puzzles that takes place in Molly/Naru's dreams.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software. Originally released on May 5, 1992, for the PC operating system MS-DOS, the game was inspired by the 1980s Muse Software video games Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein. A promotional version of Wolfenstein 3D was released as shareware, which permitted it to be copied widely. The game was later ported to a wide range of computer systems and video game consoles.The shareware release contains one episode consisting of ten levels. The commercial release consists of three episodes, which include the shareware episode and two subsequent episodes. Later releases included a three-episode mission pack titled The Nocturnal Missions. The player assumes the role of a World War II Allied spy William "B.J." Blazkowicz, who is trying to escape from Castle Wolfenstein, a Nazi German prison. After the initial escape episode, Blazkowicz carries out a series of missions against the Nazis.Wolfenstein 3D was a critical and commercial success. It is widely regarded as having helped popularize the genre on the PC and having established the basic run-and-gun archetype for many subsequent first-person shooter games.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, more specifically in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy universe. It is also the first The Lord of the Rings video game to be rated M by the ESRB. The plot for the game is that the three heroes that the players can choose from go on their own journey, similar to The Fellowship of the Ring. The characters journey to different locations to help aid in the War. Their actions help the Fellowship in a way that is not seen in the films or books. Players take control of a hero of the war and are able to play through the game alone or co-operatively with other players.The Mac OS X version of the game was developed and published by Feral Interactive and released on September 18, 2013.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Juiced is a racing video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and mobile phone. The game was delayed for release in 2004 because its original publisher, Acclaim, went bankrupt. Juice Games and Fund 4 Games retained the i.p ownership and sold the game to THQ, who funded the project for a further 6 months to make improvements.In early 2006, British software publisher Focus Multimedia re-released the PC version of Juiced at a new budget price as part of its "Essential" games range.The game offers different modes including career and arcade that present the player with challenges of increasing difficulty. A player can customize the car to suit their style and unlock new ones in arcade mode. The game features nitrous, similar to that of other racing games. This can be particularly useful when the player is behind an opponent or behind time; the AI can use nitrous oxide as well.The game system was developed at the same time as Need for Speed: Underground (which was released first and is inspired by the Shutokō Battle series),[citation needed] but the racing styles are realistic, similar to PlayStation's Gran Turismo. Damage is distinctively visible in Juiced, and must be repaired before the player can tune up the car.The game went to number 1 in the UK MCV Charts and the first version sold 2.5 million units across the various skus.</ns2:abstract>

After the initial escape episode, Blazkowicz carries out a series of missions against the Nazis.Wolfenstein 3D was a critical and commercial success. It is widely regarded as having helped popularize the genre on the PC and having established the basic run-and-gun archetype for many subsequent first-person shooter games.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Guitar Hero is a music rhythm game developed by Harmonix and published by RedOctane for the PlayStation 2 video game console. It is the first entry in the Guitar Hero series. Guitar Hero was released on November 8, 2005 in North America, April 7, 2006 in Europe and June 15, 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to America.The game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The World Is Not Enough is a first-person shooter video game based on the James Bond film of the same name. The game was published by Electronic Arts and released for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation console systems in 2000. The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Eurocom and the PlayStation version was developed by Black Ops Entertainment, who had previously developed the James Bond game Tomorrow Never Dies. Eurocom would later go on to develop the Bond games 007: Nightfire and the 2010 remake of GoldenEye. Versions of The World Is Not Enough for the PC and the PlayStation 2 were planned for release in 2000, but were later cancelled. This game marks the fifth appearance of Pierce Brosnan's James Bond, the game included his likeness but not his voice.Coming off the lukewarm reception of the previous Bond game, Tomorrow Never Dies, it was decided that The World Is Not Enough would go back to its roots as a first-person shooter, popularized by the success of the Bond game GoldenEye 007. In the Nintendo 64 version, it would also see the reintroduction of the multiplayer portion of the game.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Unreal is a first-person shooter video game developed by Epic MegaGames and Digital Extremes and published by GT Interactive in May 1998. It was powered by an original gameplay and physics engine that now bears the game's name, one that had been in development for over three years in founder Tim Sweeney's garage before the game was released.Since the release of Unreal, the franchise has had one sequel and two different series based on the Unreal universe. One official bonus pack, the Epic-released Fusion Map Pack, can be downloaded free of charge. Unreal Mission Pack: Return to Na Pali was released in June 1999, and added new missions to the single player campaign of Unreal. Unreal and Return to Na Pali would later be bundled together as Unreal Gold. Additionally, the games were updated to run on the Unreal Tournament version of the game engine.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first game in the Wizardry series of role-playing video games. It was developed by Andrew Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. In 1980, Norman Sirotek formed Sir-Tech Software, Inc. and launched a Beta version of the product at the 1980 Boston Computer Convention. The final version of the game was released in 1981.The game was one of the first Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style role-playing games to be written for computer play, and the first such game to offer color graphics. It was also the first true party-based role-playing video game.The game eventually ended up as the first of a trilogy that also included Wizardry II: The Knight of Diamonds and Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn. Proving Grounds needs to be completed in order to create a party that could play in the remainder of the trilogy.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Simpsons Game is an action/platformer video game based on the animated television series The Simpsons and loosely on the film, made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by Simpsons writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.The game follows the five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.Video game critics gave the game a mixed to positive reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.Xbox and GameCube versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled. This is possibly due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine is a multi-platform action-adventure video game by LucasArts released in late 1999. The first 3D installment in the series, its gameplay focuses on solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and various platforming sections. The story told is set between the events of Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,and puts the eponymous protagonist, the adventurer Indiana Jones, against the Soviet Union. In a race for a mythological Babylonian power source, he joins forces with the Central Intelligence Agency and collects four pieces of the Infernal Machine, a biblical device that allegedly opens a portal to another dimension.The title was designed, written, and directed by Hal Barwood who considered the Indiana Jones franchise a perfect fit for the action-adventure genre. Initially developed for the Windows 95 and 98 operating systems, the game later received an enhanced Nintendo 64 port jointly developed with Factor 5, as well as a 2D version for the Game Boy Color created by HotGen. Infernal Machine received generally favorable reviews, having been praised for its detailed storyline and sophisticated level designs, though widely criticized for its unwieldy control scheme.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The World Is Not Enough is a first-person shooter video game based on the James Bond film of the same name. The game was published by Electronic Arts and released for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation console systems in 2000. The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Eurocom and the PlayStation version was developed by Black Ops Entertainment, who had previously developed the James Bond game Tomorrow Never Dies. Eurocom would later go on to develop the Bond games 007: Nightfire and the 2010 remake of GoldenEye. Versions of The World Is Not Enough for the PC and the PlayStation 2 were planned for release in 2000, but were later cancelled. This game marks the fifth appearance of Pierce Brosnan's James Bond, the game included his likeness but not his voice.Coming off the lukewarm reception of the previous Bond game, Tomorrow Never Dies, it was decided that The World Is Not Enough would go back to its roots as a first-person shooter, popularized by the success of the Bond game GoldenEye 007. In the Nintendo 64 version, it would also see the reintroduction of the multiplayer portion of the game.</ns2:abstract>
    <ns2:abstract>The Simpsons Game is an action/platformer video game based on the animated television series The Simpsons and loosely on the film, made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by Simpsons writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another The Simpsons video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.The game follows the five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.Video game critics gave the game a mixed to positive reaction. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.Xbox and GameCube versions of the game were planned, but later cancelled. This is possibly due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold is a live-action laserdisc video game produced by American Laser Games, released for the arcade, Sega CD, 3DO, CD-i and DOS, the first release being in 1992; the quality of the video is the lowest on Sega CD. A sequel to the moderately popular Mad Dog McCree, the game abandoned the rather simple style of the original, introducing elements that can be considered "Hollywood", including dynamic shootout scenes and in-game music, as opposed to the original's almost complete lack thereof. Like the first game, the player follows the storyline and is required to quickly shoot certain enemies to proceed on the quest. The game was re-released by Digital Leisure in 2003 on DVD-Video and again in 2009 on the Wii as part of the Mad Dog McCree Gunslinger Pack, a compilation that also includes the first Mad Dog game as well as The Last Bounty Hunter.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Persona 4 Arena, known as Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena (ペルソナ4 ジ・アルティメット イン マヨナカアリーナ, Perusona Fō Ji Arutimetto In Mayonaka Arīna) in Japan, is a 2012 fighting video game, developed both by Arc System Works and Atlus based on the Shin Megami Tensei: Persona series owned by the latter company. It was released in Japan in March 2012 for arcades, and on July 26, 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. It is the second region locked game on PlayStation 3. While released in the same year in in North America, the European version was released in 2013. During the game, the player controls a user of a being called a Persona that has access to multiple type of attacks and is pitted against other Persona-users.The console versions added a story mode that expands the plot from the arcade version. The game takes place two months after the events of Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 and features characters from both that game and Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3. The plot focuses on a fighting tournament named "P-1 Grand Prix" starting in a dimension known as the Midnight Channel where characters from the Persona series are forced to fight each other using their Personas in order to progress and find the host. The main composer is Shoji Meguro and the music includes both new and rearranged themes.Atlus requested Arc System Works' collaboration to make Persona 4 Arena with the former handling the story and the latter the gameplay. Persona 4 Arena became one of the fastest selling fighting games in Japan with 90% of its stock sold in its debut week. Reviews for the game have been positive with critics praising the gameplay and graphics employed while the length of the story mode was criticized. A sequel, titled Persona 4 Arena Ultimax was later released, featuring new characters and abilities.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:name>The Con</ns2:name>
    <ns2:abstract>The Con, released as Gamble Con Fight in Japan, is a fighting video game that was released for the PlayStation Portable on October 18, 2005. It was developed by Think &amp; Feel Inc. The story follows the life of a con artist who fights for money.A Con artist is introduced to underground fighting by Reina. He/she wins twice and then the protagonist is taught how to make money, and he/she has to do the following: Fight to win, Pull off a comeback con, start like a loser and make a comeback, and take a dive, start like a winner and then lose.Then Reina is killed by Kuro. The protagonist then recruits two other fighters and form a team. Team (name) fight to get invited to the Big Time, where the winners of the tournament get 10 million dollars. They defeat Boneyard and his team Phantom of rank D (24-2), Smoke and his team Extreme of rank C (26-2),Shaman and his team Demoish of team B (36-2), Cinder and her team Crimson of rank A (52-6) and opotionally, Cornfed and his team Triumph (57-0) (it is not requiered to defeat team Triumph to go to the Big Time Tournament.) But when that team jumps to rank A, Smoke, whom they fought at rank C, will want to join his/her team. If the protagonist wants him, he/she is going to have to choose which fighting style Smoke is going to fight as. Yes, Smoke masters every style in the game. But at the cost of another team member. One is going home, while Smoke joins the team. If he/she says no, he leaves immediately and there is no other offer.Once they get to the Big Time tournament, that team fights to the finals, in the semi-finas defeating Shades and his team. But something strange happens during the finals. If the player accepted Smoke's offer, he betrayes the team to join team Mencace, alongside Cornfed and Kuro (they may have fought Cornfed at rank S already.) If he/she did not accept it, one of the team members is killed. Either way, that team is going to have to fight team Menace with two members.But still, they defeat team Menace and bring home that prize money, and optionally the protagonist avenges Reina's death.Quick PlayThere are three modes: arcade, time-attack- and survival.Quick play: in this mode, there are eleven stages. The first nine are random, and the final two are always the same: Hardcase, a supposedly disgraced man as he wears a cloth which covers his mouth and has scars on his body, and Mask a man whose fighting style is dependent on the player; if the player is a street boxer, he is a street boxer too, etc.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Linger in Shadows is a Demoscene project by the Polish demogroup Plastic, released exclusively on the PlayStation 3. It was first announced at Breakpoint 2008 in Germany. Linger in Shadows differs in an important aspect from many demoscene products in that it is being published by Sony on the PlayStation 3, who trademarked the name late 2007.Many news sites which reported about the demo assumed that it was a tech demo for a future game. This was denied during presentations at E3, although it was revealed that the title does feature interactivity.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Drac's Night Out is the title of an unreleased video game developed by Mark Lesser and Rex Bradford of Microsmiths that was produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe.In the game the player controlled the infamous Count Dracula who, while wearing Reebok Pumps, had to first work his way down his castle while avoiding the hostile villagers. This could be accomplished by hypnotizing the villagers with your vampiric gaze. Or by pulling a lever to spring one of many Rube Goldberg-esque hidden traps. Once subdued, you can then suck their blood and briefly turn into a bat to navigate through the tower. Scattered throughout these towers is also a Reebok Pump power-up. Once activated, you are given a temporary speed-boost as well as the ability to jump over villagers and holes.When you escape the castle you are then given a large open town to explore and search for your bride Mina. This will require hints such as finding maps and compasses from villagers. Patrolling the streets are hostile mobs and non hostile villagers. After sucking enough blood, you temporarily transform into an invulnerable wolf to cover distance more quickly.You are also given the ability to suck the blood of sleeping villagers that will transform into Vampiresses and lead you nearer to Minas location. Some villagers drop items like keys and flowers, used to open gates and homes. You can also travel through secret underground shortcuts. Once you discover the building housing Mina, a congratulatory picture of the pair walking together appears and leads to the next 'round'.Although completed the game was never officially released. However, a prototype has since been discovered and its ROM data released to the internet. Elaborate NES cart reproductions now exist for collectors as well.Mark Lesser on the Reebok Pump addition:"We developed this game as consultants to Parker Bros. As we neared completion of the game, PB insisted that we include Reebok as a sponsor of the game by having Dracula wear Reebok Pump shoes! Reluctantly we complied, but the sponsorship was not enough to save the game and, although completed, it was never marketed."</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>ViOS (Visual Internet Operating System) was a client-server software system designed by Julian Lombardi in the mid-1990s and built by a team he led at ViOS Inc. from 1999-2001 as a way of spatially organizing all Internet-deliverable resources (including web pages) into a massively scaled multiuser 3D environment with users of the system represented as customizable avatars. The basic concept behind the "ViOS 3D Internet Viewer" was to take the virtual world of the entire Internet and adapt it to a physical representation of large virtual landscape, complete with mountains, rivers and cities. This approach was taken because of the belief that virtual landscapes resembling our physical world are more conducive to exploration and social interaction than the flat and abstracted world of the current document-based Internet.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The ImagiNation Network (INN), aka The Sierra Network (TSN) and CyberPark, was an early online multiplayer gaming system. Developed by Sierra On-Line in 1989, and first available to the public in 1991, the ImagiNation Network was a unique online gaming network that gave subscribers from all over the U.S. a place where they could "play games, make friends and have fun". With a wide variety of games including RPGs, a World War I aeroplane simulations, live trivia, card and board games, almost every user could find something enjoyable to play. INN also featured an electronic post office, many bulletin boards, chat rooms, and the company boasted of having "more than 200 groups, clubs and special events online."Sierra On-Line founder Ken Williams wanted to create a network that even his grandmother would find easy to use, and to that end INN featured a unique emphasis on a friendly, graphics-heavy interface. Each user was represented by a persona which they assembled using INN's built-in 'facemaker'. The facemaker was incredibly detailed, with enough different options to construct over 84 million unique personas. Users could then indicate their level of skill in various games, in order to encourage fair match-making between players, and a short list of hobbies to help match interests with new friends.</ns2:abstract>

A sequel to the Heavy Metal 2000 animated movie, the game stars Julie in her quest to save her home planet of Eden from GITH, an ancient entity seeking to conquer the universe. Using a variety of weapons, Julie must now fight off GITH's forces while at the same time uncovering a secret hidden deep within the planet.FAKK2 allows players to pair up and use two weapons at the same time depending on the situation - for example, sword and shield for maximum defense, sword and UZI for both range and melee capability, or dual-wield UZIs for maximum firepower. Players can also block enemy attacks and execute powerful combo moves to deal even deadlier blows to their enemies. The game uses the Quake III Arena engine (modified with Ritual's ÜberTools) and combines action with puzzle-solving. The game was ported to Linux by Loki Software, who had previously ported Quake III Arena to Linux.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Big Kahuna Reef is a tile-matching puzzle video game created by Reflexive Entertainment. Released in 2004 on the PC, it became the first of a series of Big Kahuna titles. The look of the game is that of ocean scenes, exotic fish and tiki heads.It is a match-making casual game that involves breaking boxes in order to progress past each level. To beat a level a player must break all the boxes by making chains of objects (such as starfish or shells). Between levels, points are earned that unlock new fish and other undersea creatures. During the interludes between levels, one can create and observe their personal reef and its creatures. Reflexive also created a sequel called Big Kahuna Reef 2 in addition to a title called Big Kahuna Words in which the game play mechanic is similar to the other two titles, but instead of busting boxes with chains of similar objects, one must make words (akin to the game Boggle).There are thousands of additional free user-created levels created by people from around the world (similar to the Ricochet Infinity series).</ns2:abstract>

Both the board and computer game portray the same basic concept: the players manage ancient Mediterranean civilizations in an effort to move them from the early Bronze Age to beyond the Iron Age. It was published in 1995, shortly before Avalon Hill was bought out by Hasbro in 1998.[citation needed] It came out about the same time that Sid Meier's Civilization II was released, and as a result, didn't do well commercially.[citation needed] The game was also slightly hobbled in that it was developed for MS-DOS, so while it ran from Windows 95, it ran as a DOS application.</ns2:abstract>

A sequel to the moderately popular Mad Dog McCree, the game abandoned the rather simple style of the original, introducing elements that can be considered "Hollywood", including dynamic shootout scenes and in-game music, as opposed to the original's almost complete lack thereof. Like the first game, the player follows the storyline and is required to quickly shoot certain enemies to proceed on the quest. The game was re-released by Digital Leisure in 2003 on DVD-Video and again in 2009 on the Wii as part of the Mad Dog McCree Gunslinger Pack, a compilation that also includes the first Mad Dog game as well as The Last Bounty Hunter.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Burnout Revenge is the fourth video game in the Burnout series of racing games. It was developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on 13 September 2005 and Xbox 360 on 7 March 2006, alongside the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS title Burnout Legends.Similar to its predecessor Burnout 3: Takedown, Revenge focuses on a mixture of racing in the midst of rush-hour traffic, and vehicular combat; players use the cars themselves as weapons. Revenge also expands on the combat side of its gameplay with new features such as "traffic checking" (ramming same-way traffic), Vertical Takedowns (landing on a rival car after the player's car drives over a jump), a new game type (Traffic Attack) and significant changes to the gameplay of Crash mode (a game type where players attempt to cause as large a crash as possible). A sequel to Burnout Revenge, titled Burnout Paradise, was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 22 January 2008. Like its predecessor, the game was not available for the GameCube due to its original publisher of the series first 2 games Acclaim Entertainment going bankrupt then Electronic Arts picked up Burnout 3 which was also not available for the GameCube, and then further delayed as changes were made to the game and Burnout: Revenge couldn't do a GameCube version either and while the successors were released for the PS3 and Xbox 360, the games were not available on the Nintendo Wii or any of the Nintendo game systems.</ns2:abstract>

The game was released by Hudson Soft, with developers who also worked on Hudson's video game adaptations of SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West.The normally bumbling Gadget is portrayed as fairly competent as he must rescue his niece Penny from the clutches of Dr. Claw and his M.A.D. terrorist organization. Dr. Claw's face makes a rare appearance in the game, unlike the cartoon, which keeps his face hidden. A hidden debug menu is used to test certain options like god mode, a stage select with every playable level available, and a complete test of all the sound effects/music found while playing the game.</ns2:abstract>

This casual game is a three in a row matchmaking game. The player must make strings of objects in order to break the boxes beneath; when all of the boxes are broken the level is complete. Like the title before it, Big Kahuna Reef 2 has thousands of user-made levels that can be downloaded in game, in addition to the standard levels made by the developer. Big Kahuna Reef 2 also introduced power-ups (bombs), hence the extended title Chain Reaction.</ns2:abstract>
    <ns2:abstract>Big Kahuna Reef is a tile-matching puzzle video game created by Reflexive Entertainment. Released in 2004 on the PC, it became the first of a series of Big Kahuna titles. The look of the game is that of ocean scenes, exotic fish and tiki heads.It is a match-making casual game that involves breaking boxes in order to progress past each level. To beat a level a player must break all the boxes by making chains of objects (such as starfish or shells). Between levels, points are earned that unlock new fish and other undersea creatures. During the interludes between levels, one can create and observe their personal reef and its creatures. Reflexive also created a sequel called Big Kahuna Reef 2 in addition to a title called Big Kahuna Words in which the game play mechanic is similar to the other two titles, but instead of busting boxes with chains of similar objects, one must make words (akin to the game Boggle).There are thousands of additional free user-created levels created by people from around the world (similar to the Ricochet Infinity series).</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold is a live-action laserdisc video game produced by American Laser Games, released for the arcade, Sega CD, 3DO, CD-i and DOS, the first release being in 1992; the quality of the video is the lowest on Sega CD. A sequel to the moderately popular Mad Dog McCree, the game abandoned the rather simple style of the original, introducing elements that can be considered "Hollywood", including dynamic shootout scenes and in-game music, as opposed to the original's almost complete lack thereof. Like the first game, the player follows the storyline and is required to quickly shoot certain enemies to proceed on the quest. The game was re-released by Digital Leisure in 2003 on DVD-Video and again in 2009 on the Wii as part of the Mad Dog McCree Gunslinger Pack, a compilation that also includes the first Mad Dog game as well as The Last Bounty Hunter.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:name>Cause of Death: Can you Catch the Killer?</ns2:name>
    <ns2:abstract>Cause of Death: Can you Catch the Killer? (almost always shortened to Cause of Death or CoD) is a video game developed and published by EA Mobile for iOS devices on December 16, 2010. While being almost identical in gameplay, the game is intended for a more mature audience than its companion game Surviving High School, as the game revolves around crime and serial killers and their pursuit by law enforcement (and it's text depicts some rather graphic and suggestive things at times). Understandingly, the suggested age on the App Store is 12+. Cause of Death is a visual novel that is divided into a series of volumes, each of which is made up of eight chapters (excluding the first and fourteenth volumes). The base game (which is free from the App Store) comes with the entire first Volume—future content must be downloaded either by "Episodes on Demand" or "Now Airing".</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Madden NFL 97 is the first Madden NFL football game to be created in the 32-bit gaming era. It was originally created for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, but other versions were also released, including the 16 bit Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis.This was the first edition of Madden to implement the use of a salary cap when customizing team rosters. It also featured the new Baltimore Ravens, the expansion franchise that absorbed the roster of the Cleveland Browns for the 1996 season. The game also adds a team of real free agents (as opposed to the blank slate used in Madden 96) which can be traded and added to other teams' rosters (led by recently semi-retired quarterback Randall Cunningham), and could be played by using a cheat code.Classic teams were once again used, although most were different from the previous year's teams; the years ranged as far back as 1952 (Detroit Lions) and as recent as 1990 (Buffalo Bills). Jacksonville and Carolina, once again, did not get classic teams, but Baltimore was attached to a classic Cleveland Browns team.The best team in the overall ranking, with a score of 85 was the Dallas Cowboys and the worst team with a score of 62 was the Baltimore Ravens. The best ranked offenses were between the Cowboys and the Lions with a score of 92. The St. Louis Rams had the best ranked defense with an 86. The Miami Dolphins had the best ranked special teams with a 93.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Astrosmash is a video game for the Intellivision videogame console written by John Sohl and published by Mattel in 1981. In this game, the player controls a laser cannon protecting the earth from falling asteroids and other threats. It sold over 1 million copies and replaced Las Vegas Poker &amp; Blackjack as the Intellivision's pack-in game.The Intellivision games catalog gives the following description of Astrosmash: "Spin. Blast. And drop into hyperspace to avoid a killer asteroid shower. Power on. Attack computer engaged. Fire a quick burst at the alien antagonists. Got 'em!"Astrosmash was conceived as Avalanche! after Meteor! did not take up the cartridge's entire ROM space. Meteor!, an Asteroids clone, was cancelled to avoid a lawsuit and Avalanche! was released as Astrosmash. The resultant game borrows elements from Asteroids and Space Invaders.Astrosmash is like many space-shooter games of its era and involves shooting bombs, asteroids, missiles and flying saucers. It is somewhat similar to the game Asteroids in that most of the target objects are rocks that break apart into smaller pieces when shot, and the player can enter "hyperspace" as an evasive maneuver and be transported to a random position on the screen; however, the player's cannon is more akin to that in Space Invaders as it is situated on a planetary surface and thus can only move from side to side.The object of the game is straightforward; objects fall from the sky at increasingly fast speeds and the player must shoot them before they hit their cannon.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Vampire Hunter D is a PlayStation video game based on the series of books and movies of the same name. Along with Countdown Vampires, it is one of the few survival horror games to revolve around vampires. The gameplay is similar to the earlier games in the Resident Evil series; because characters are fully polygonal, whereas the backgrounds are pre-rendered. The story of the game is similar to that of the second movie, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (which, in turn, is based on the third novel). Essentially, D, a Dhampir (transliterated as Dunpeal) vampire hunter is hired by an old man named Elbourne to save his daughter Charlotte, who was kidnapped by a vampire, Meier Link. If his daughter was already transformed into a vampire, then D should kill her humanely. Also, Elbourne's son hired a team of human vampire hunters known as the Marcus Brothers to serve as backup. There are though, some differences between the game and the movie.Only two of the Barbarois mutants (Benge and Mashira) appear as enemies, Caroline being not featured. Borgoff and Leila were the only members of the Marcus brothers which were notably featured; Kyle, Nolt, and Grove just make some cameos in cutscenes, and later are found dead. There are 3 possible endings based on your actions in-game, 1 of which is similar to the end of the film. The game shares some of the voice actors of the film.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Fishing Derby is an Atari 2600 fishing video game created by Activision programmer David Crane.In Fishing Derby, two fishermen sit on opposite docks over a lake filled with fish (and a shark that passes through). Using the joystick the player is able to move his line left right and up and down in the water. When a fish is hooked, the line slowly comes up to the surface of the water. Pressing the fire button on the joystick reels in the fish faster. However, if both fishermen have fish hooked, only one person can reel theirs in (the one who hooked theirs first). The shark that roams the water will try to eat hooked fish before they surface.The objective for both fishermen is to reach 99 pounds of fish first. There are six rows of fish; the top two rows have 2 lb. fish, the middle two rows have 4 lb. fish, and the two bottom rows have 6 lb. fish. The more valuable fish sit at the bottom, but they are harder to bring in as they run a higher risk of being eaten by the shark.The game's two variants are simply single player and multi-player. In both games the objective is to reach 99 lb. of fish first.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Battle Beast is a side-scrolling fighting game released for the PC in 1995. In the style of Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, a player can play against another human opponent or computer-controlled opponents in different levels using hand-to-hand combat, special moves and weapons to defeat each other. A distinct feature in Battle Beast is the use of animals, which can transform into large robotic machines to battle one another. Players can select 6 different animals, which start off as cutesy-looking pets but all transform into large robots to fight, each animal has its own specific special combat techniques, weapons and attributes.Players can fight on various levels in the single player mode as they advance through "sewers" to reach the final boss, a large Toad (Toadman), and complete the game. There are also several mini-games mixed in between the fights such as races through mazes and secret bonus rooms to collect upgrades and weapons.Multiplayer can be direct human to human combat, with two players battling each other on the same computer or across a LAN network or the internet. Players can also battle in a cooperative mode together, where two players can progress through the single player levels together.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Amazing Spider-Man is an action-adventure video game, which is a tie-in to the film of the same name featuring the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man. It was developed by Beenox, developer of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions and Spider-Man: Edge of Time, and published by Activision. It was released June 26, 2012 in North America and June 29, 2012 in Europe, on Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android, iOS, and Microsoft Windows. On October 13, 2012, it was confirmed that it will be coming to Wii U, in Spring 2013, this version was released March 5, 2013 in North America and March 8, 2013 in Europe as The Amazing Spider-Man: Ultimate Edition in both regions. A PlayStation Vita version was also confirmed to be in development.The game was directed by Gerard Lehiany and written by Seamus Kevin Fahey, of Battlestar Galactica fame, Benjamin Schirtz and Gérard Lehiany. The game serves as an epilogue to The Amazing Spider-Man film.The Nintendo 3DS and Wii version feature a different, more linear game with the same script and plot. The game is not open world, instead following a style of approach similar to that of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, where the player selects a level from a hub, in this case Stan's apartment, before playing a mostly linear level. It was natively designed for the 3DS, and later ported to the Wii. Beenox also developed this version.</ns2:abstract>

Players can pick stunned enemies up and throw them at other enemies to destroy them. Destroyed enemies leave behind fruit which can be collected for points. Once all enemies are destroyed play proceeds to the next level which is generally more difficult.Throughout the game, various power-ups can be collected, which represent potions, hammers, or books help the players' character speed up, receive more power, or kill in different ways. In certain screens various secret levels can be accessed.The game was ported over to the Nintendo Entertainment System and TurboGrafx-16.

    <ns2:abstract>The ImagiNation Network (INN), aka The Sierra Network (TSN) and CyberPark, was an early online multiplayer gaming system. Developed by Sierra On-Line in 1989, and first available to the public in 1991, the ImagiNation Network was a unique online gaming network that gave subscribers from all over the U.S. a place where they could "play games, make friends and have fun". With a wide variety of games including RPGs, a World War I aeroplane simulations, live trivia, card and board games, almost every user could find something enjoyable to play. INN also featured an electronic post office, many bulletin boards, chat rooms, and the company boasted of having "more than 200 groups, clubs and special events online."Sierra On-Line founder Ken Williams wanted to create a network that even his grandmother would find easy to use, and to that end INN featured a unique emphasis on a friendly, graphics-heavy interface. Each user was represented by a persona which they assembled using INN's built-in 'facemaker'. The facemaker was incredibly detailed, with enough different options to construct over 84 million unique personas. Users could then indicate their level of skill in various games, in order to encourage fair match-making between players, and a short list of hobbies to help match interests with new friends.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Stay Tuned for Danger was the 2nd installment in the Nancy Drew point-and-click adventure game series by Her Interactive. It was officially discontinued in 2011. The game had an ESRB rating of E for moments of mild violence and peril. Players took on the first-person view of fictional amateur sleuth Nancy Drew and solved the mystery through interrogation of suspects, solving puzzles, and discovering clues. The game featured longer game play and improved graphics compared to the previous game, Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill. It was also the first game in the series to feature three-dimensional suspects. There were two levels of gameplay, Junior and Senior detective modes, each offering a different difficulty level of puzzles and hints, however none of these changes affected the actual plot of the game. The game was loosely based on a book of the same name Stay Tuned for Danger (1987).</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:name>Suspended: A Cryogenic Nightmare</ns2:name>
    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Devil May Cry 4 is an action-adventure hack and slash video game that was published and developed by Capcom in 2008 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows platforms. The game is the fourth installment to the Devil May Cry series. It later on generated a handheld version released on iOS, titled Devil May Cry 4: Refrain. Chronologically, the game is set between the original Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 2.The story follows Nero, a teenager possessing demonic powers who is on a mission to stop the series' main character, Dante, after he assassinates demons from the The Order of the Sword including its leader. During the game, the player controls both Nero and Dante as they fight enemies in close combat using firearms, swords, and other weapons. Devil May Cry 4 was the first entry in the series to release for multiple consoles at the same time; during its development, Capcom focused on all versions achieving the same visual quality.Critical reception to Devil May Cry 4 has been positive with praise aimed towards its challenging difficulty and the characters' special moves. However, it has been criticized for its backtracking and a troublesome camera. The game has sold 2.7 million units worldwide, becoming the series' best-selling title. It has also been adapted into a two-volume light novel by its original writer, Bingo Morihashi.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Rifts: Promise of Power is a video game licensed for the Rifts role-playing game (RPG) from Palladium Books, released on September 10, 2005 for the Nokia N-Gage. It is currently the first and only adaptation of the Rifts RPG series to an electronic media format. Due to the failure of the N-Gage platform in the North American market, however, the game is very difficult to find.The basic mechanics of the game are adapted from the pen-and-paper version, utilizing an Action Point turn based system similar to Fallout and X-Com.Character classes available in Promise of Power represent a broad but shallow sampling of the dozens presented in the RPG series. There are three proto-classes from among which players can select at the outset of the game: Mercenary, Psionic, and Magic User. Upon reaching fourth level, players may choose a specialization such as Borg, Burster, or Ley Line Walker, some of which are restricted based on proto-class. One character class specially designed for the game – the Elemental Fusionist – was adapted into the Rifts Ultimate Edition core rulebook.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is the third major platform game installment in the Rayman series. It tells the story of how Rayman stops André, an evil black lum, from taking over the world with his army of sack-like "Hoodlum" soldiers. Unlike the game's predecessor, Rayman 3 took a more light-hearted turn, it has sarcastic self-referential undertones and pokes fun at the platforming video game genre. It was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows by Ubisoft in 2003 and OS X by Feral Interactive in 2004. A remastered HD version of the game was released for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in 2012. 2D versions were developed for the Game Boy Advance and N-Gage. A follow up game, Rayman: Hoodlums' Revenge, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2005.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Ghost Manor is a horror video game that was released by Xonox in 1983 for the Atari 2600 and the Vic-20. It was generally packaged in a double ended cartridge and a cassette tape along with one of three other games in an effort to appeal to budget conscious buyers who would purchase two games for the price of one cartridge and one cassette tape. There was also a more limited release of single ended cartridges and cassette tapes containing Ghost Manor by itself. The double ended cartridges and cassette tapes paired Ghost Manor with the platform game Spike's Peak, the fighting game Chuck Norris Superkicks, and a strategy game called Artillery Duel.A release entitled Ghost Manor was released by TTI for the TurboGrafx-16. It has no relation to the Atari 2600 or Vic-20 release of Ghost Manor.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Fishing Derby is an Atari 2600 fishing video game created by Activision programmer David Crane.In Fishing Derby, two fishermen sit on opposite docks over a lake filled with fish (and a shark that passes through). Using the joystick the player is able to move his line left right and up and down in the water. When a fish is hooked, the line slowly comes up to the surface of the water. Pressing the fire button on the joystick reels in the fish faster. However, if both fishermen have fish hooked, only one person can reel theirs in (the one who hooked theirs first). The shark that roams the water will try to eat hooked fish before they surface.The objective for both fishermen is to reach 99 pounds of fish first. There are six rows of fish; the top two rows have 2 lb. fish, the middle two rows have 4 lb. fish, and the two bottom rows have 6 lb. fish. The more valuable fish sit at the bottom, but they are harder to bring in as they run a higher risk of being eaten by the shark.The game's two variants are simply single player and multi-player. In both games the objective is to reach 99 lb. of fish first.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Astrosmash is a video game for the Intellivision videogame console written by John Sohl and published by Mattel in 1981. In this game, the player controls a laser cannon protecting the earth from falling asteroids and other threats. It sold over 1 million copies and replaced Las Vegas Poker &amp; Blackjack as the Intellivision's pack-in game.The Intellivision games catalog gives the following description of Astrosmash: "Spin. Blast. And drop into hyperspace to avoid a killer asteroid shower. Power on. Attack computer engaged. Fire a quick burst at the alien antagonists. Got 'em!"Astrosmash was conceived as Avalanche! after Meteor! did not take up the cartridge's entire ROM space. Meteor!, an Asteroids clone, was cancelled to avoid a lawsuit and Avalanche! was released as Astrosmash. The resultant game borrows elements from Asteroids and Space Invaders.Astrosmash is like many space-shooter games of its era and involves shooting bombs, asteroids, missiles and flying saucers. It is somewhat similar to the game Asteroids in that most of the target objects are rocks that break apart into smaller pieces when shot, and the player can enter "hyperspace" as an evasive maneuver and be transported to a random position on the screen; however, the player's cannon is more akin to that in Space Invaders as it is situated on a planetary surface and thus can only move from side to side.The object of the game is straightforward; objects fall from the sky at increasingly fast speeds and the player must shoot them before they hit their cannon.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>187 Ride or Die is a video game for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, developed and published by Ubisoft. In order to become "top dog" of the game the player must race and defeat opponents through a variety of different stages all set in Los Angeles's infamous South Central region.The game's title comes from two phrases common in the subculture. 187 is the California Penal Code section that defines murder. It has come into general use among gangs in the United States as a synonym for murder, and this usage has passed into popular culture via gangsta rap. "Ride or die" is a combination of the phrases "ride it out" and "die trying", meaning one is willing to do anything even if it involves personal risk.If playing with another player, one can be the driver and the other can be the shooter. This can be done in the story and online mode. There are a variety of modes available to the player.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Ōkami (Japanese: 大神, literally "great god", "great spirit" or "wolf" if written as 狼) is an action-adventure video game developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom. It was released for Sony's PlayStation 2 video game console in 2006 in Japan and North America, and 2007 in Europe and Australia. Despite the closure of Clover Studio a few months after the game's initial release, a version for Nintendo's Wii console was developed and produced by Ready at Dawn, Tose and Capcom, which was released in North America in April 2008, in Europe in June 2008, and in Japan in October 2009.Set sometime in classical Japanese history, Ōkami combines several Japanese myths, legends and folklore to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the Shinto sun goddess, named Amaterasu, who took the form of a white wolf. It features a distinct sumi-e-inspired cel-shaded visual style and the Celestial Brush, a gesture-system to perform miracles.Ōkami was one of the last PlayStation 2 games selected for release prior to the release of the PlayStation 3. Although it suffered from poor sales, Ōkami received critical acclaim, earning the title of IGN's 2006 Game of the Year. The Wii version has earned similar praise though the motion control scheme has received mixed reviews.A high-definition port of the game was released on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network in October 2012 and for retail in Japan in November 2012, supporting the use of the PlayStation Move motion controller. A sequel for the Nintendo DS titled Ōkamiden was released in Japan in September 2010, followed by North America and Europe in March 2011.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge, known as Rockman World (ロックマンワールド, Rokkuman Wārudo) in Japan, is a platform video game by Capcom for the Nintendo Game Boy. It is the first game in the handheld series of the Mega Man franchise. It was first released in Japan on July 26, 1991 and was localized in North America that December and in Europe the following year. The game continues the adventures of the android hero Mega Man as he once again confronts the evil Dr. Wily, who has recently dispatched his revived "Robot Masters" and a new "Mega Man Killer" named Enker.Dr. Wily's Revenge is an action and platform game in same vein as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games. The player is tasked with completing a series of four stages in any order desired. Beating a stage's boss will earn the player a special weapon that can be selected at will and used throughout the rest of the game. Dr. Wily's Revenge specifically takes components of the original Mega Man and Mega Man 2, including their enemies, stage aesthetics, and Robot Masters.According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was the first Mega Man game to be outsourced to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Nier is an action role-playing video game developed by Cavia and published by Square Enix. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Australia, Europe, Japan and North America in April 2010. In Japan, the game was released as Nier Gestalt for the Xbox 360, while an alternate version entitled Nier Replicant was released for PlayStation 3 with a younger main character. The game is a spin-off from the Drakengard series, and follows follows the fifth ending of first game, the events of which have left the planet Earth in a state of decay. Set over one thousand years after this, the game puts the player in control of the titular protagonist Nier, as he attempts to find a cure for an illness, known as the Black Scrawl, to which his daughter Yonah has succumbed. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, Kainé and Emil, as he attempts to find a remedy and understand the nature of the creatures known as Shades that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various video game genres, switching to them from the primary action role-playing style.The game was developed to appeal both to older players and to players outside of Japan, where the developer was based. The music was composed by Keiichi Okabe, head of Monaca, a music composition studio, and has sparked the release of several albums. Nier was released to mixed reception; reviewers praised the story, characters and soundtrack and were mixed in their opinions of how well the disparate gameplay elements were connected. Criticism was given for the execution of some gameplay elements, particularly the side quests, and was especially pronounced for the graphics, which were regarded as substandard.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Viva Piñata: Pocket Paradise is a life simulation game developed by Rare, for the Nintendo DS video game console and based on the original Viva Piñata, rather than being an all-new game in the series.This version was developed by Rare's handheld team, as opposed to Viva Piñata: Party Animals and the PC version of the original game, which were developed by separate third-party developers. This is Rare's second Nintendo DS project, after Diddy Kong Racing DS, which was developed by the same team. This is so far, the only game in the Viva Piñata series to not have a Japanese release.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The Amazing Spider-Man is an action-adventure video game, which is a tie-in to the film of the same name featuring the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man. It was developed by Beenox, developer of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions and Spider-Man: Edge of Time, and published by Activision. It was released June 26, 2012 in North America and June 29, 2012 in Europe, on Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android, iOS, and Microsoft Windows. On October 13, 2012, it was confirmed that it will be coming to Wii U, in Spring 2013, this version was released March 5, 2013 in North America and March 8, 2013 in Europe as The Amazing Spider-Man: Ultimate Edition in both regions. A PlayStation Vita version was also confirmed to be in development.The game was directed by Gerard Lehiany and written by Seamus Kevin Fahey, of Battlestar Galactica fame, Benjamin Schirtz and Gérard Lehiany. The game serves as an epilogue to The Amazing Spider-Man film.The Nintendo 3DS and Wii version feature a different, more linear game with the same script and plot. The game is not open world, instead following a style of approach similar to that of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, where the player selects a level from a hub, in this case Stan's apartment, before playing a mostly linear level. It was natively designed for the 3DS, and later ported to the Wii. Beenox also developed this version.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Cauldron is a two-dimensional (2D) shoot 'em up/platformer computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace). The game was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a witch, who aims to become the "Witch Queen" by defeating an enemy called the "Pumpking".Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron originated as licensed video game of the horror film Halloween. Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized that there were no technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.The game received praise from video game magazines, who focused on the graphics and two different modes of play. A common complaint was Cauldron's excessive difficulty. The following year, Palace released a direct sequel titled Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back.</ns2:abstract>

In the enormous upheaval that followed, one of these species would gain ascendancy."The iOS version of Ascendancy is a Universal app, meaning it is designed for both the iPad and the iPhone/iPod touch platforms.The original Ascendancy was released during a golden age of 4X space games in the mid-1990s. Several reviewers praised the game for having great graphics, being entertaining, and being fun to play.The original version of the game won the Software Publisher's Association Codie Award for Best Strategy Software of 1996, as voted on by games industry members.The music of the game was composed by Nenad Vugrinec. The intro and a few other themes have some resemblance to the "Into the Crystal Cave" theme from Final Fantasy III.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Rifts: Promise of Power is a video game licensed for the Rifts role-playing game (RPG) from Palladium Books, released on September 10, 2005 for the Nokia N-Gage. It is currently the first and only adaptation of the Rifts RPG series to an electronic media format. Due to the failure of the N-Gage platform in the North American market, however, the game is very difficult to find.The basic mechanics of the game are adapted from the pen-and-paper version, utilizing an Action Point turn based system similar to Fallout and X-Com.Character classes available in Promise of Power represent a broad but shallow sampling of the dozens presented in the RPG series. There are three proto-classes from among which players can select at the outset of the game: Mercenary, Psionic, and Magic User. Upon reaching fourth level, players may choose a specialization such as Borg, Burster, or Ley Line Walker, some of which are restricted based on proto-class. One character class specially designed for the game – the Elemental Fusionist – was adapted into the Rifts Ultimate Edition core rulebook.</ns2:abstract>

A remake of the original PC version of Far Cry, Instincts is less open-ended and more linear, due to the console's reduced processing power which prevents the full rendering of the PC version's vast islands and landscape. However, Instincts added new multiplayer modes, weapons, and feral abilities, the latter being reflected in the modified storyline. Ports of the game were also planned for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube but were canceled.An arcade version developed by Global VR was released in 2007 under the name Paradise Lost.Ubisoft has released a sequel, Far Cry Instincts: Evolution for the Xbox. Also released was Far Cry Instincts: Predator for the Xbox 360, which contains both Far Cry Instincts and Evolution running in high definition mode.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Agatha Christie: Evil Under the Sun is a video game released for the PC and Nintendo Wii, and is the third installment of The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series, developed by AWE Productions, based on Agatha Christie's novel Evil Under the Sun. The game was released in October 2007.Evil Under The Sun features Hercule Poirot as the protagonist, unlike the previous game in the series, Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express, which had featured Poirot as a non-playable character. It also features numerous improvements and expanded gameplay elements, with a new inventory system, dialogue choices, and more environments. While players take the role of Poirot, they are actually playing as Captain Hastings playing as Poirot, in an interactive scenario designed by Poirot in order to allow his long-time friend a chance to solve the mystery in the way Poirot would.The game's plot follows Poirot as he investigates the murder of a noted actress on an island. It is divided into two sections: story-time, in which Poirot uncovers the secrets of Seadrift Island and real-time, in Poirot's office in London in which the player, as Captain Hastings, can request hints, review information and consult the locations of the suspects on a wall map.Despite the fact that the murderer remains the same, new plot aspects are included, such as new characters, a slight change of location, and the fact that Hastings becomes a part of the plot. Poirot's voice is performed by actor Kevin Delaney.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Madness and the Minotaur is a text adventure game for the TRS-80 Color Computer. Developed by Spectral Associates in 1981, the game lulls players into a false sense of security by providing a comparatively easy and static early game. Once the player walks down the stairs, however, the game rapidly degenerates into what may have been the most difficult text adventure labyrinth ever created.The goal of the game is to retrieve a number of treasures. In the course of doing this, the player will encounter other objects that may or may not be useful. Often, the player needs one object to act as a "key" for another. There is no rhyme or reason to this. The player doesn't use the key object to obtain the other; he just needs to be carrying it. For example, the player may see a shield. Perhaps the player needs to be carrying the dagger to get the shield. If the player has the dagger, the shield is reachable; if he does not, it is not. With the exception of a randomly appearing "oracle", the game gives no indication of what objects are needed to reach a treasure. There are various magic spells that can be learned throughout the game that have various effects.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Lewis Hamilton: Secret Life is the second alternate reality game from the developer nDreams (the first ARG being Xi). Lewis Hamilton: Secret Life was not based in PlayStation Home like Xi was. The ARG was created for Reebok, who also co-developed the game. Wired called it 'one of the most engaging, interactive, and exciting games of 2010.'Lewis Hamilton: Secret Life was the first time a global sport star - in this case Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton - has featured as the central character in a game of this kind. The storyline for each episode showcased a new Reebok technology such as RunTone or ZigTech.Describing his role in the game, Lewis Hamilton said; “Working on Lewis Hamilton: Secret Life with Reebok has been a great experience. It’s been a massive project and I’ve met people all over the world who’ve been involved. I’ve enjoyed playing a secret agent in the game and it’s a different way to put my ZigTechs through their paces. It is a shame to have to bring it to an end, after working on such an exciting project”.The game incorporated a maze of fictional websites and characters as well as specially created online games. The game launched in March 2010 and ran until November 2010, with over 637,000 players from 154 countries taking part. They worked together to solve puzzles and complete tests online, on mobiles and in the real world. Live events took place across the globe including tasks in Spain, Lebanon, Malaysia, India and the UK. The game was run in nine languages (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Turkish and Korean), which Guinness acknowledged as a world record for a game of this type in 2013.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Battle Beast is a side-scrolling fighting game released for the PC in 1995. In the style of Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, a player can play against another human opponent or computer-controlled opponents in different levels using hand-to-hand combat, special moves and weapons to defeat each other. A distinct feature in Battle Beast is the use of animals, which can transform into large robotic machines to battle one another. Players can select 6 different animals, which start off as cutesy-looking pets but all transform into large robots to fight, each animal has its own specific special combat techniques, weapons and attributes.Players can fight on various levels in the single player mode as they advance through "sewers" to reach the final boss, a large Toad (Toadman), and complete the game. There are also several mini-games mixed in between the fights such as races through mazes and secret bonus rooms to collect upgrades and weapons.Multiplayer can be direct human to human combat, with two players battling each other on the same computer or across a LAN network or the internet. Players can also battle in a cooperative mode together, where two players can progress through the single player levels together.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>The ImagiNation Network (INN), aka The Sierra Network (TSN) and CyberPark, was an early online multiplayer gaming system. Developed by Sierra On-Line in 1989, and first available to the public in 1991, the ImagiNation Network was a unique online gaming network that gave subscribers from all over the U.S. a place where they could "play games, make friends and have fun". With a wide variety of games including RPGs, a World War I aeroplane simulations, live trivia, card and board games, almost every user could find something enjoyable to play. INN also featured an electronic post office, many bulletin boards, chat rooms, and the company boasted of having "more than 200 groups, clubs and special events online."Sierra On-Line founder Ken Williams wanted to create a network that even his grandmother would find easy to use, and to that end INN featured a unique emphasis on a friendly, graphics-heavy interface. Each user was represented by a persona which they assembled using INN's built-in 'facemaker'. The facemaker was incredibly detailed, with enough different options to construct over 84 million unique personas. Users could then indicate their level of skill in various games, in order to encourage fair match-making between players, and a short list of hobbies to help match interests with new friends.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back is a computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace) as a sequel to their 1985 title Cauldron. The two-dimensional (2D) platform game was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a bouncing pumpkin that is on a quest of vengeance against the "Witch Queen". The roles of the two were reversed from the first game, in which the witch defeated a monster pumpkin.Following the success of Cauldron, Palace employee Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.Cauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64. It was released in the following years on other systems and as re-releases. The game received praise, mainly for its audio-visuals, in video game magazines. Difficulty in handling the bouncing pumpkin's movement was a common complaint, although reviewers felt the overall package was of good value.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Madden NFL 09 is an American football video game based on the NFL that was published by EA Sports and developed by EA Tiburon. It is the 20th annual installment in the Madden NFL video game franchise. The game was released for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles, as well as mobile devices such as the iPod. It was also the last game ever made for the Xbox. A GameCube version was cancelled due to the system's discontinuation in 2007.Unlike previous versions, the game was not released for the PC. EA Sports has said that they are "retooling the PC version" after not making 09. Despite these claims of 'retooling', PC users were again ignored the following year as no Windows version of Madden NFL 10 were released. In June 2009, EA Sports announced that for the year 2010, the games Madden NFL, NCAA Football, NASCAR, NHL, NBA Live, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour would not be shipped for Microsoft Windows.The Wii version of the game is titled Madden NFL 09 All-Play and was launched under EA Sports' new All-Play brand exclusive to the platform, taking a slightly different approach to the game and taking advantage of the motion controls.The 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition of Madden NFL 09 includes NFL Head Coach 09, an alternative case, an exclusive version of John Madden Football '93 with updated teams and rosters and bonus video content and clips. A demo of the game was released on Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network. The standard version and the anniversary package were released on August 12, 2008. As of August 12, 2008, the game was the last title released for the original Xbox. A Spanish-language version of the game was released on September 17, 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Magicka is an action-adventure video game based on Norse mythology and developed by Swedish independent developer Arrowhead Game Studios. It was released via Steam for Microsoft Windows on January 25, 2011. A free demo was also made available for download. The game was developed by eight students at Luleå University of Technology in Skellefteå, Sweden and sold over 200,000 copies in its first 17 days on sale. It had sold 1.3 million copies and 4 million DLC packs as of January 2012, making it one of the most successful games published by Paradox Interactive and was credited with a 250% rise in profits for Paradox during 2012.In Magicka, up to four mages of a sacred order travel to fight against an evil sorcerer and his creations. The game world is based loosely on Norse mythology, drawing inspiration from other fantasy games like Warhammer and Diablo, while also making regular use of comedy and self-referential humor. The game also takes liberties when it comes to the classic fantasy setting, at one point supplying the players with an M60 machine gun. In expansions the game also explores a Vietnam War setting as well as the Lovecraftian Cthulhu universe.</ns2:abstract>

It was released in August 2004 in Japan, and early 2005 in North America and Europe.Suikoden IV takes place approximately 150 years before the events of the first Suikoden game, and relates the story of a young boy living on the island of Razril and the Rune of Punishment, one of the 27 True Runes. The Rune of Punishment governs both atonement and forgiveness, and is unusual in that it consumes the life of the bearer with use; once the previous bearer dies, it immediately jumps to someone nearby. Meanwhile, the Kooluk Empire seeks to expand into the nearby Island Nations.Konami later produced Suikoden Tactics, a spinoff that serves as a direct prequel, side-story, and sequel to Suikoden IV.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Cauldron is a two-dimensional (2D) shoot 'em up/platformer computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace). The game was released in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a witch, who aims to become the "Witch Queen" by defeating an enemy called the "Pumpking".Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron originated as licensed video game of the horror film Halloween. Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the Halloween holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized that there were no technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.The game received praise from video game magazines, who focused on the graphics and two different modes of play. A common complaint was Cauldron's excessive difficulty. The following year, Palace released a direct sequel titled Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back.</ns2:abstract>

It was generally packaged in a double ended cartridge and a cassette tape along with one of three other games in an effort to appeal to budget conscious buyers who would purchase two games for the price of one cartridge and one cassette tape. There was also a more limited release of single ended cartridges and cassette tapes containing Ghost Manor by itself. The double ended cartridges and cassette tapes paired Ghost Manor with the platform game Spike's Peak, the fighting game Chuck Norris Superkicks, and a strategy game called Artillery Duel.A release entitled Ghost Manor was released by TTI for the TurboGrafx-16. It has no relation to the Atari 2600 or Vic-20 release of Ghost Manor.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold is a live-action laserdisc video game produced by American Laser Games, released for the arcade, Sega CD, 3DO, CD-i and DOS, the first release being in 1992; the quality of the video is the lowest on Sega CD. A sequel to the moderately popular Mad Dog McCree, the game abandoned the rather simple style of the original, introducing elements that can be considered "Hollywood", including dynamic shootout scenes and in-game music, as opposed to the original's almost complete lack thereof. Like the first game, the player follows the storyline and is required to quickly shoot certain enemies to proceed on the quest. The game was re-released by Digital Leisure in 2003 on DVD-Video and again in 2009 on the Wii as part of the Mad Dog McCree Gunslinger Pack, a compilation that also includes the first Mad Dog game as well as The Last Bounty Hunter.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Rebel Moon Rising is a PC game made by Fenris Wolf and GT Interactive. In the future, the Moon has been colonized, and due to political conflicts, the Lunar colonies are rebelling against the United Nations. In the game, the player is on the side of the Lunar alliance, fighting against United Nation forces. The game later takes a twist, when an alien species is discovered.The PlayStation version of the game was cancelled, although the Windows version was released.This game is also the sequel to the rarely found game "Rebel Moon". With the same basis as Rising, the player takes on 27 levels in the original "Rebel Moon", quite a few more levels than Rising. Rebel Moon was only found in a bonus disk with the Creative Labs software "3D BLASTER PCI".The series was also supposed to have a third game "Rebel Moon Revolution", but it was cancelled by GT Interactive. Due to insufficient communications about the cancellation, Fenris Wolf instated a lawsuit against GT Interactive.The game disc itself also doubled as a soundtrack disc that can operate on stereo or musical disc systems, playing the game soundtrack.The PC shareware version of Rebel Moon Rising was included on disc 2 of the EIDOS Interactive game Blood, copyright 1997.A novelization of Rebel Moon, written by Bruce Bethke, was published in 1996.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>ViOS (Visual Internet Operating System) was a client-server software system designed by Julian Lombardi in the mid-1990s and built by a team he led at ViOS Inc. from 1999-2001 as a way of spatially organizing all Internet-deliverable resources (including web pages) into a massively scaled multiuser 3D environment with users of the system represented as customizable avatars. The basic concept behind the "ViOS 3D Internet Viewer" was to take the virtual world of the entire Internet and adapt it to a physical representation of large virtual landscape, complete with mountains, rivers and cities. This approach was taken because of the belief that virtual landscapes resembling our physical world are more conducive to exploration and social interaction than the flat and abstracted world of the current document-based Internet.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master.Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands ("hit troll"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions ("hit the troll with the Elvish sword").</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Guardic (ガーディック, Gādikku) is a shoot 'em up video game for the MSX computer. It was created and developed by Satoshi "Pac" Fujishima while working for Compile, the creators of other shoot 'em up games such as Zanac, The Guardian Legend, and Blazing Lazers. Guardic is unique in that the player can choose stages, which are connected by a maze. Each stage is a non-scrollable single screen and has 1 to 3 groups of different enemies. The player can "buy" ship power-ups like speed, weaponry, and special powers before each stage—a departure from the traditional scrolling-shooter power-up system. In the end of each stage, the ship could safely fly through a scrollable maze to another stage.Guardic is the second title in a MSX trilogy by Fujishima, which started with Final Justice (1985) and ended with Blaster Burn (1990). In this last installment the player commands Guardic II as its main weapon against Gose, an invasion army from outer space. It did inspire a cult classic of a sequel, the NES shooter The Guardian Legend (known as Guardic Gaiden in Japan).In August 2011 D4 Enterprise released an emulated version for iOS devices.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Super ZZT is the successor to ZZT, created by Allen Pilgrim and Tim Sweeney of Epic Games (then Epic MegaGames). Like its predecessor, Super ZZT was essentially a game creation system with a few games packaged with it, which included Lost Forest, Monster Zoo, and Proving Grounds. Like ZZT, the greatest draw to its sequel was the level editor which allowed players to create their own games. The editor itself was somewhat "hidden" by the creators, perhaps because it was not quite as polished as they wanted in time for the release. It was necessary to add the argument /e to the command line when loading Super ZZT, and then to press E to enter the editor.Some changes to this version include floor textures, new prefabricated enemies and objects, and scrolling maps, allowing for much larger worlds than ZZT would allow. Although Super ZZT is in many ways a vast improvement over ZZT, it never caught on with the ZZT community like the original ZZT did, and very few games were ever created for Super ZZT. However, notable game creation group Interactive Fantasies did create 3 Super ZZT games.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Astrosmash is a video game for the Intellivision videogame console written by John Sohl and published by Mattel in 1981. In this game, the player controls a laser cannon protecting the earth from falling asteroids and other threats. It sold over 1 million copies and replaced Las Vegas Poker &amp; Blackjack as the Intellivision's pack-in game.The Intellivision games catalog gives the following description of Astrosmash: "Spin. Blast. And drop into hyperspace to avoid a killer asteroid shower. Power on. Attack computer engaged. Fire a quick burst at the alien antagonists. Got 'em!"Astrosmash was conceived as Avalanche! after Meteor! did not take up the cartridge's entire ROM space. Meteor!, an Asteroids clone, was cancelled to avoid a lawsuit and Avalanche! was released as Astrosmash. The resultant game borrows elements from Asteroids and Space Invaders.Astrosmash is like many space-shooter games of its era and involves shooting bombs, asteroids, missiles and flying saucers. It is somewhat similar to the game Asteroids in that most of the target objects are rocks that break apart into smaller pieces when shot, and the player can enter "hyperspace" as an evasive maneuver and be transported to a random position on the screen; however, the player's cannon is more akin to that in Space Invaders as it is situated on a planetary surface and thus can only move from side to side.The object of the game is straightforward; objects fall from the sky at increasingly fast speeds and the player must shoot them before they hit their cannon.</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Hello Kitty: Happy Party Pals is the first Hello Kitty game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Unlike the other Hello Kitty games which are usually aimed at very young children, this game is more like a Sims-style game targeting an older audience as well.The goal of the game is for Hello Kitty to plan a party. She must collect gifts, food, and entertainment for her party. She must also create party invitations and give them to her friends and family. Many of the various characters from Sanrio are present in the game. The characters have 'Happy Meters' floating above their heads. The idea is for Hello Kitty to keep all the characters happy so they have a good time at the party. If the characters are happy by the end of the party, then the player will receive a good 'party rating'. In addition to the main party world, there are an additional 13 mini-games to play. There are special codes received at the end to continue from where you last finished.sv:Hello Kitty (datorspel)#Hello Kitty: Happy Party Pals</ns2:abstract>

    <ns2:abstract>Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine is a multi-platform action-adventure video game by LucasArts released in late 1999. The first 3D installment in the series, its gameplay focuses on solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and various platforming sections. The story told is set between the events of Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,and puts the eponymous protagonist, the adventurer Indiana Jones, against the Soviet Union. In a race for a mythological Babylonian power source, he joins forces with the Central Intelligence Agency and collects four pieces of the Infernal Machine, a biblical device that allegedly opens a portal to another dimension.The title was designed, written, and directed by Hal Barwood who considered the Indiana Jones franchise a perfect fit for the action-adventure genre. Initially developed for the Windows 95 and 98 operating systems, the game later received an enhanced Nintendo 64 port jointly developed with Factor 5, as well as a 2D version for the Game Boy Color created by HotGen. Infernal Machine received generally favorable reviews, having been praised for its detailed storyline and sophisticated level designs, though widely criticized for its unwieldy control scheme.</ns2:abstract>
